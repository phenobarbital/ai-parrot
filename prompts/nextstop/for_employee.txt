Using data returned from `get_by_employee_visits` tool executes the following task:

## 4. Visit Performance Metrics by Employee
Employee ID: {employee_id}

### Task
For each of the four key questions (column_name: '9730', '9731', '9732', '9733'), extract and analyze the data:
- Question 9730 (Key Wins): Summarize positive outcomes and successes across all employee visits.
- Question 9731 (Challenges/Opportunities): Identify recurring issues and improvement areas across visits.
- Question 9732 (Next Visit Focus): Analyze follow-up priorities and action items for future visits.
- Question 9733 (Competitive Landscape): Evaluate market positioning and visibility concerns across stores.

#### Extraction rules
1. Work **only** with the literal text inside each `answer`.
2. A phrase, theme or issue is valid **only if that exact substring appears** in an answer.
3. If none are found, return nothing.
4. After each list item, add "(#row_index)" indicating the first visit row where it occurs.

### For each Question (9730, 9731, 9732, 9733) provide:
• **Top Phrases:** up to 5 frequent key phrases present in `answer` (lower-cased, stemmed/lemmatized).
• **Themes:** Identify business-relevant terms like product names, competitor names, specific issues, store features, customer behaviors referenced in `answer`.
• **Key Issues:** Identify the most frequently mentioned issues or challenges across all employee visits.
  * up to 5 issues/challenges ranked by frequency.
• **Sentiment Counts:** evaluate all `answer` for every VisitAnswer in `visit_data`
  - Positive: X, Negative: Y, Neutral: Z
    *Positive > 0, Negative < 0, Neutral ≈ 0 (TextBlob polarity scale).*
• **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Extract one sample answer for positive, negative and neutral from `answer`.
• **"Most Relevant Answer":** the answer that best exemplifies the key issues (highest phrase overlap).
• **Insights:** Identify any actionable insights based exclusively on phrases and patterns across visits.

**Do NOT** aggregate multiple questions together. **Do NOT** summarize across questions. **Do NOT** omit any of the seven bullets above.

## 5. Employee Performance Trends – Visit_1 vs. (Visit_2 & Visit_3)

### Visits to analyze
Rank the rows by visit_timestamp DESC and label them:
  • Visit_1  = most-recent
  • Visit_2  = previous-1
  • Visit_3  = previous-2

For **each** question `column_name` produce:

### Question column_name
• **Sentiment Trend:** ↑ / ↓ / →  (based on net-positive – net-negative)
• **New Issues:** issues appearing **only** in Visit_1
• **Resolved Issues:** issues present earlier but **absent** in Visit_1
• **Persisting Issues:** issues that appear in all visits
• **Notable Phrase Shifts:** any big change in Top Phrases frequency
• **Overall Assessment:** "Better / Worse / No Material Change" with one-sentence rationale
• **Performance Development:** How has the employee's approach or effectiveness changed between visits?

## 6. Employee Development Recommendations

### Based on Visit Analysis
• **Training Needs:** Identify specific areas where additional training would benefit the employee
• **Best Practices to Reinforce:** What successful approaches should the employee continue?
• **Improvement Areas:** Priority areas for performance enhancement
• **Territory Management:** Recommendations for optimizing store coverage and visit scheduling
• **Goal Setting:** Suggested metrics and targets for future performance measurement

### Action Plan
• **Short-term (Next 30 days):** Immediate focus areas and quick wins
• **Medium-term (Next Quarter):** Skills development and process improvements
• **Long-term (Next 6 months):** Career development and territory expansion opportunities
