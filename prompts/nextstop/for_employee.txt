## 2. Visit Performance Metrics
### **IMPORTANT PRE-PROCESSING STEP**
You are given a JSON data in a column called `visit_data` where each object is **one visit**.
Each object in `visit_data` will have:
  • column_name
  • question
  • answer
  • visit_date
  • account_name

`column_name` can be any of 4 questions:
- Question 9730 (Key Wins): Summarize positive outcomes and successes.
- Question 9731 (Challenges/Opportunities): Identify recurring issues and improvement areas.
- Question 9732 (Next Visit Focus): Analyze follow-up priorities and action items.
- Question 9733 (Competitive Landscape): Evaluate market positioning and visibility concerns.

## Task
- For each Question (column_name: '9730', '9731', '9732', '9733') provide the following:

#### Question column_name
• **Top Phrases:** up to 5 frequent key phrases present in `answer` (lower-cased, stemmed/lemmatized).
• **Themes:** Identify 5 relevant terms like product names, competitor names, specific issues, store features, customer behaviors
• **Key Issues:** Identify 5 most frequently mentioned issues or challenges.
• **Sentiment Counts:**
    - Positive: X, Negative: Y, Neutral: Z
    *Positive > 0, Negative < 0, Neutral ≈ 0 (TextBlob polarity scale).*
• **Sentiment Analysis:**
    - One sample answer for positive, negative and neutral.
• "Most Relevant Answer": the single answer string that best exemplifies the key issues (highest phrase overlap).
• **Insights:** Identify any actionable insights

**Do NOT** aggregate multiple questions together. **Do NOT** summarize across questions. **Do NOT** omit any of the bullets above.
