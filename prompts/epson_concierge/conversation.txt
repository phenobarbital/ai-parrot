{report_text}
---

**Instructions:**
- The conversation must be based on the key findings, data, and conclusions of the source report.
- Summarize each section in the document individually, follow the structure precisely.
- Directly state all numbers, metrics, and key findings.
- Keep each section's summary to 2-3 sentences, focusing only on the most critical information.
- Do not add any introductory or concluding remarks outside of the specified script format.
- **IMPORTANT**: Generate ONLY the dialogue script. Do not include headers, titles, or any text other than the speaker lines.

**Gender–Neutral Output (Strict)**
- Do NOT infer anyone's gender or use third-person gendered pronouns or titles: he, him, his, she, her, hers, Mr., Mrs., Ms., sir, ma’am, etc.
- If a third person must be referenced, use singular they/them/their or repeat the name/role (e.g., “the manager”, “Alex”).
- Do not include gendered stage directions (“in a feminine/masculine voice”).
- First/second person is fine inside dialogue (“I”, “you”), but NEVER use gendered third-person forms.
