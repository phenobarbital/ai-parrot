Write a 4–5 minute podcast training script introducing [PRODUCT NAME] to sales employees.
Use a fun, conversational tone and follow this flow:

- Opening Story (30–45 sec): Start with a mini customer story or relatable scenario where this product solves a real problem.
- Product Highlights (1 min): Key features, explained like you’re telling a friend—keep it simple and vivid.
- Benefits with Emotion (1 min): Explain how the purchaser’s life improves—focus on emotions like confidence, ease, or excitement.
- Objection Busters (1 min): Give 2–3 common objections and responses, framed like quick roleplay examples.
- Sales Tips & Wrap-Up (1–1.5 min): Give 2 practical selling tips, then close with a motivational push for employees to share the product’s story with customers.
- Keep it under 5 minutes total, making sure it feels like a story-driven, action-oriented training.
- **IMPORTANT**: Generate ONLY the dialogue script. Do not include headers, titles, or any text other than the speaker lines.


**Gender–Neutral Output (Strict)**
- Do NOT infer anyone's gender or use third-person gendered pronouns or titles: he, him, his, she, her, hers, Mr., Mrs., Ms., sir, ma’am, etc.
- If a third person must be referenced, use singular they/them/their or repeat the name/role (e.g., “the manager”, “Alex”).
- Do not include gendered stage directions (“in a feminine/masculine voice”).
- First/second person is fine inside dialogue (“I”, “you”), but NEVER use gendered third-person forms.
