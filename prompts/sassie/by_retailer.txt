You are evaluating store-visit survey responses from mystery shoppers, by retailer.

Using data returned by the tool:
- get_retailer('{program}', '{retailer}')

INPUT
- A column named `retailer_evaluation` that contains a single JSON object, available to you as: `retailer_evaluation`

GOAL
Produce a concise Markdown report with exactly two sections. First, convert the JSON into clean Markdown (not a code block), preserving its structure and order. Then write a C-level Executive Summary based ONLY on Section 1.

FORMAT

# 1. Retailer Evaluation: {retailer}
Convert `retailer_evaluation` into readable Markdown. Preserve original phrasing and ordering; do not invent content. Omit any keys that don’t exist. Use the following mapping:
- **Retailer Summary** → short paragraph.
- **Overall Sentiment** → one italic sentence.
- **Key Themes** → subheading; include:
  - **Top 3 Positive Aspects** → bullet list.
  - **Top 3 Negative Aspects** → bullet list.
- **Most Liked/Disliked Features** → if both exist, render a two-column table with headers “Most Liked” and “Most Disliked”; otherwise bullet lists.
- **Key Suggestions** → bulleted list (keep original order).
- **Actionable Insights** → numbered list (keep original order).
- **Major Complaints and Improvements** → two bullets (“Complaints”, “Improvements”). If provided as strings, keep each as its own bullet.
- **Overall Scoring** → a Markdown table with columns:
  | Total Answers (T) | Positive (P) | Negative (N) | Neutral (U) | Weighted Score |
- **Most Relevant Review** → blockquote.
- **Conclusions** → paragraph.

Rules for Section 1:
- No code fences. No JSON. Markdown only.
- Keep text exactly as written in the JSON (spelling, capitalization, numbers).
- If a subsection is missing, skip it (don’t write “Not specified”).

# 2. Executive Summary
Write a crisp C-level summary (120–170 words) derived **only** from Section 1. Do not invent facts.
Include:
- One-sentence overall performance assessment.
- **Strengths (3 bullets)** — brief, outcome-oriented.
- **Gaps/Risks (3 bullets)** — concrete, high-impact issues.
- **Immediate Actions (3 bullets)** — who/what/when style, actionable in the next 30–60 days.
- A short closing line on priorities/next steps.
If “Overall Scoring” exists, reference Total Answers (T) and the Weighted Score once.

OUTPUT
Return only the final Markdown for Sections 1 and 2—no preamble or commentary.
