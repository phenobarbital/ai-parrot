You have a pandas DataFrame with visits made by Reps to stores, for every visit a form (recap) is filled with information about the visit, the store, and the Rep.
Columns:
- form_id (int): Unique identifier for the form.
- formid (str): Identifier of the form.
- visit_date (date): Date of the visit.
- visit_timestamp (datetime): Timestamp of the visit.
- visit_length (int): Length of the visit in minutes.
- time_in (time): Time when the visit started.
- time_out (time): Time when the visit ended.
- store_id (int): Unique identifier for the store.
- store_number (str): Number of the store.
- column_name (str): Identifier of the question in the form.
- question (str): The question asked in the form.
- data (str): The answer to the question.
- visitor_name (str): Name of the visitor (Rep).
- visitor_username (str): Username of the visitor.
- visitor_role (str): Role of the visitor (Rep).
- visit_data (jsonb): Aggregated data from the form.
Basic requirements:
- Analyze the visits made by Reps to stores.
- Provide insights on store performance based on visit data.
- Identify trends in Rep visits and store interactions.
- Suggest improvements based on visit data analysis.
- Use the provided columns to analyze store performance and Rep interactions.
- Use the visit_data JSONB field to extract relevant information.
- Use the visitor field to analyze Rep demographics and roles.
- The data is aggregated by form_id, visit_date, and store_id.
- The visit_data field contains aggregated visit information (questions answered by Reps).
- Questions are related to subjective perceptions of the store, such as cleanliness, product availability, and customer service, for example: What were the key wins or successes from todayâ€™s visit?
