00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,351
Speaker1: acting crazy all day.

193
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:41,853
Speaker2: No worries.

194
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:44,777
Speaker1: OK,

195
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:47,861
Speaker1: perfect.

196
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:48,421
Speaker1: So it looks

197
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,303
Speaker1: like

198
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:50,124
Speaker1: the transcript

199
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,925
Speaker1: itself is

200
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,447
Speaker1: you might have to like piece

201
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,067
Speaker1: together some

202
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:53,989
Speaker1: parts to it like

203
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,190
Speaker1: you could the

204
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,051
Speaker1: language barrier

205
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:56,852
Speaker1: because he's got a really

206
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:57,173
Speaker1: strong

207
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,134
Speaker1: accent. So

208
00:03:58,194 --> 00:03:59,035
Speaker1: some of the.

209
00:03:59,504 --> 00:03:59,724
Speaker1: Some

210
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:00,505
Speaker2: of the words look

211
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:00,825
Speaker1: funny.

212
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:02,026
Speaker1: I see what

213
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:02,367
Speaker1: it

214
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,327
Speaker1: says quite

215
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:04,528
Speaker1: clearly is

216
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:05,409
Speaker1: about the

217
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,310
Speaker1: weekends, and I'm more

218
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,991
Speaker1: looking for what

219
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:07,971
Speaker1: you said to

220
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:08,232
Speaker1: him.

221
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,415
Speaker1: You can see where it

222
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:13,176
Speaker1: says the 23

223
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:14,357
Speaker1: an hour, because I know that

224
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,278
Speaker1: was one of the other things

225
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:15,478
Speaker1: he

226
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:16,899
Speaker1: mentioned multiple

227
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:17,440
Speaker1: times. I

228
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,300
Speaker1: told him 24,

229
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:19,842
Speaker1: but I didn't. I

230
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:20,743
Speaker1: told him 23. And

231
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:22,965
Speaker1: his offer letter says

232
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:23,545
Speaker1: 23. The

233
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:24,526
Speaker1: job posting on

234
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:25,427
Speaker1: Trusted Heard says

235
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:25,787
Speaker1: 23.

236
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,268
Speaker1: So

237
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:28,189
Speaker1: I'm not sure where

238
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:28,730
Speaker1: he got 24

239
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,190
Speaker1: from.

240
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:31,671
Speaker1: Probably

241
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,254
Speaker1: the same place he

242
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,095
Speaker1: heard that this was a

243
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:34,596
Speaker1: full-time

244
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:35,057
Speaker1: job.

245
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,065
Speaker1: It's clear that he

246
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:40,807
Speaker1: understands here.

247
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:42,610
Speaker1: He even repeats

248
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,717
Speaker1: it.

249
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:47,499
Speaker1: I

250
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,500
Speaker1: figured that was going to

251
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,282
Speaker1: be the case, but

252
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:50,243
Speaker1: I needed to meet

253
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,045
Speaker1: with you guys so

254
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:51,466
Speaker1: that I could

255
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:52,127
Speaker1: actually

256
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:53,269
Speaker1: get those

257
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,030
Speaker1: details.

258
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:55,043
Speaker1: So,

259
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:57,066
Speaker1: Gerardo, now

260
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:57,767
Speaker1: let's move

261
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:58,728
Speaker1: to to

262
00:04:58,788 --> 00:04:59,449
Speaker1: what started

263
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,090
Speaker1: happening

264
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,113
Speaker1: after

265
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:02,454
Speaker1: that.

266
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:04,196
Speaker1: Because I do

267
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:05,018
Speaker1: see where

268
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:05,478
Speaker1: he was

269
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,580
Speaker1: basically

270
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,261
Speaker1: spamming

271
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,563
Speaker1: the

272
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:09,404
Speaker1: team's chats

273
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:10,306
Speaker1: and why we would have

274
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:11,067
Speaker1: removed him from

275
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:11,928
Speaker1: those chats.

276
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,270
Speaker1: But

277
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,472
Speaker1: what was the

278
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:15,954
Speaker1: the reason why we

279
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:16,555
Speaker1: said he was

280
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:17,156
Speaker1: threatening?

281
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:19,940
Speaker2: Yeah, so I

282
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,182
Speaker2: mean,

283
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,572
Speaker2: So I really started

284
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:23,435
Speaker2: communicating with them just

285
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:24,337
Speaker2: like the last two weeks,

286
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:25,300
Speaker2: though, because

287
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,443
Speaker2: this

288
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,045
Speaker2: program,

289
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,950
Speaker2: these

290
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,872
Speaker2: reports to

291
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:30,213
Speaker2: Joe

292
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,076
Speaker2: Pacino's

293
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:31,758
Speaker2: field

294
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:32,640
Speaker2: managers.

295
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:33,463
Speaker2: And

296
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,365
Speaker2: they're a

297
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,206
Speaker2: little busy right now with

298
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:35,947
Speaker2: so many things.

299
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:36,888
Speaker2: And this

300
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:37,750
Speaker2: program,

301
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,851
Speaker2: really this

302
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:39,612
Speaker2: Costco is a

303
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,373
Speaker2: test. If we

304
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:40,574
Speaker2: were

305
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,056
Speaker2: successful, were there

306
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:42,476
Speaker2: sales,

307
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:43,698
Speaker2: then we might

308
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:44,640
Speaker2: get more work from them.

309
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,022
Speaker2: So I actually

310
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:46,943
Speaker2: stepped in the last

311
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:47,744
Speaker2: two weeks to

312
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:48,685
Speaker2: have team

313
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:49,527
Speaker2: calls just

314
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:49,687
Speaker2: to

315
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:50,829
Speaker2: talk to them about

316
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:51,690
Speaker2: sales training,

317
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,431
Speaker2: how to engage a

318
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:52,871
Speaker2: customer

319
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:53,412
Speaker2: at

320
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:54,394
Speaker2: Costco, get a

321
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:55,175
Speaker2: hook and all that

322
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:55,896
Speaker2: kind of stuff. So

323
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:57,318
Speaker2: my interaction just

324
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:57,578
Speaker2: really

325
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:58,780
Speaker2: started,

326
00:05:58,861 --> 00:05:59,642
Speaker2: about two weeks

327
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:00,363
Speaker2: ago and

328
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:01,244
Speaker2: the

329
00:06:01,304 --> 00:06:02,145
Speaker2: first, was that

330
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:02,846
Speaker2: email that I already

331
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:03,547
Speaker2: forwarded to you

332
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,488
Speaker2: where he

333
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:05,169
Speaker2: was just talking

334
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:05,670
Speaker2: about,

335
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:06,931
Speaker2: you know,

336
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:07,893
Speaker2: T-ROC

337
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:08,013
Speaker2: and

338
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:08,974
Speaker2: discrimination

339
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:09,194
Speaker2: and,

340
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:10,436
Speaker2: know, the white

341
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,377
Speaker2: man and just

342
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:13,840
Speaker2: kind of just scrunchles

343
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,562
Speaker2: about

344
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:16,303
Speaker2: that. So I actually

345
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:16,784
Speaker2: called him

346
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:17,745
Speaker2: after

347
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:18,466
Speaker2: that and I just

348
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:19,207
Speaker2: said, when

349
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:19,968
Speaker2: Anish, I got your

350
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:20,789
Speaker2: email and I

351
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:21,911
Speaker2: said, it

352
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,032
Speaker2: seems like you're just

353
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:23,853
Speaker2: frustrated. Do you not

354
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:24,294
Speaker2: want to do the

355
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:24,854
Speaker2: program

356
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:25,796
Speaker2: anymore?

357
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:26,136
Speaker2: Because he

358
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:26,877
Speaker2: was,

359
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:27,569
Speaker2: I'm playing about

360
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:28,250
Speaker2: our, about

361
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,171
Speaker2: our incentives,

362
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:29,812
Speaker2: whatnot. And,

363
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:31,735
Speaker2: and I said, I said,

364
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:32,035
Speaker2: you know, I,

365
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:32,937
Speaker2: I get your

366
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:33,678
Speaker2: frustration. I

367
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:34,279
Speaker2: said, I

368
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker2: can't, I wish I could

369
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,141
Speaker2: fix the world. I can't

370
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:37,063
Speaker2: fix the world, but what I

371
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:37,924
Speaker2: can do is help you

372
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:38,685
Speaker2: with sales on this,

373
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:39,626
Speaker2: you know, my focus is

374
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,428
Speaker2: program. He

375
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:41,109
Speaker2: apologized.

376
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,410
Speaker2: Um,

377
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:43,833
Speaker2: and, and then we left at

378
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:44,153
Speaker2: that

379
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:45,235
Speaker2: really. And

380
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:45,916
Speaker2: then on

381
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:46,897
Speaker2: Wednesday, or

382
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:47,518
Speaker2: I'm sorry, this

383
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:48,439
Speaker2: Friday is when he

384
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,000
Speaker2: started.

385
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:49,783
Speaker2: with the

386
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,544
Speaker2: bombardments of

387
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:51,285
Speaker2: text messages

388
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,468
Speaker2: on

389
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,089
Speaker2: the chats.

390
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:54,830
Speaker2: So

391
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,912
Speaker2: I thought that

392
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:56,813
Speaker2: Storm had calmed,

393
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:57,193
Speaker2: because I

394
00:06:58,015 --> 00:06:58,856
Speaker2: thought maybe he didn't

395
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,757
Speaker2: want to work

396
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:00,658
Speaker2: on the program. And

397
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:00,979
Speaker2: then I

398
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,741
Speaker2: hadn't not talked to him

399
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:03,682
Speaker2: really after that.

400
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:04,503
Speaker2: And then you

401
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:05,084
Speaker2: saw the text

402
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:05,705
Speaker2: messages that he

403
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:06,025
Speaker2: started

404
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:09,490
Speaker2: posting there. And

405
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:10,692
Speaker2: I'm going to sue you.

406
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:10,812
Speaker2: Well,

407
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:13,976
Speaker2: actually, I'll take it back. I

408
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,457
Speaker2: did call on

409
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,358
Speaker2: Friday.

410
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,283
Speaker2: I did talk to him on

411
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:16,683
Speaker2: Friday

412
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:17,685
Speaker2: because I

413
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:18,786
Speaker2: couldn't turn off the

414
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:19,667
Speaker2: chat. And I said,

415
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:20,248
Speaker2: oh, you know,

416
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:21,890
Speaker2: I'll take the back. I did

417
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,471
Speaker2: talk to him,

418
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:24,013
Speaker2: but I

419
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,475
Speaker2: realized I couldn't.

420
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:26,336
Speaker2: He was not

421
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:27,016
Speaker2: talkable.

422
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:27,918
Speaker2: He was just

423
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:29,700
Speaker2: frustrated and,

424
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,182
Speaker2: you know, started

425
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:31,983
Speaker2: threatening and

426
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:32,984
Speaker2: all that kind of stuff,

427
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:33,865
Speaker2: you know. Right. But

428
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:34,186
Speaker1: he was

429
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:35,147
Speaker1: threatening to

430
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,108
Speaker1: sue. But what

431
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,029
Speaker1: else was he threatening?

432
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:37,710
Speaker1: Was he threatening

433
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,671
Speaker1: anything other than he

434
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:39,412
Speaker1: was going to sue?

435
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:41,515
Speaker2: He

436
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,416
Speaker2: well, it's so

437
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:43,978
Speaker2: with

438
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:45,832
Speaker2: Well, he was threatening,

439
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:47,154
Speaker2: because he was just

440
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:47,834
Speaker2: going off, and

441
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:49,036
Speaker2: by then I was

442
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:49,676
Speaker2: trying to figure out how to

00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,358
Speaker2: kind of get off the phone.

00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,149
Speaker2: T-Rock is,

569
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,031
Speaker2: you know, they

570
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:03,152
Speaker2: discriminate and

571
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:03,932
Speaker2: the poor

572
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:04,853
Speaker2: people and

573
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,416
Speaker2: earlier

574
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:08,157
Speaker2: he said, well, you're a brown

575
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:08,717
Speaker2: person so you

576
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:09,338
Speaker2: understand

577
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,098
Speaker2: that, but

578
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,019
Speaker2: then he's like, but you're

579
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,059
Speaker2: a

580
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:13,182
Speaker2: T-Rock manager

581
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:14,042
Speaker2: too, you know?

582
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:15,464
Speaker2: And by then I just wanted

583
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,345
Speaker2: to get off the call

584
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:16,865
Speaker2: because

585
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:17,586
Speaker2: it

586
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:18,927
Speaker2: was the way that I

587
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,168
Speaker2: was just feeling, I was

588
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:20,569
Speaker2: feeling just

589
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:21,870
Speaker2: threatened by him,

590
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,851
Speaker2: you know? And I

591
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:23,071
Speaker2: thought,

592
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:23,852
Speaker2: man,

593
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,319
Speaker2: his tone of the voice,

594
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,162
Speaker2: I thought, geez, he's going to

595
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:26,422
Speaker2: come

596
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,047
Speaker2: down

597
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:28,588
Speaker2: to my house.

598
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,551
Speaker2: Just how I

599
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,293
Speaker2: felt.

600
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,116
Speaker2: It

601
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:31,216
Speaker2: was

602
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,038
Speaker2: just

603
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:32,961
Speaker2: such a horrible

604
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,164
Speaker2: tone.

605
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,227
Speaker2: It

606
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:35,909
Speaker2: was very

607
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:36,711
Speaker2: uncomfortable.

608
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:37,876
Speaker2: And that's where I started

609
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,657
Speaker2: feeling way

610
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:39,597
Speaker2: uncomfortable. And I've

611
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:40,458
Speaker2: never experienced this in

612
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:40,999
Speaker2: my life

613
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:41,439
Speaker2: with

614
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,860
Speaker2: someone just

615
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,422
Speaker2: so much anger

616
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:45,002
Speaker2: inside him.

617
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:47,044
Speaker2: But he never

618
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:48,045
Speaker2: physically said, I'm gonna

619
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:48,946
Speaker2: beat you up,

620
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:49,386
Speaker2: I'm

621
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:50,808
Speaker2: gonna hit

622
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:51,668
Speaker2: you. There's

623
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,589
Speaker2: no

624
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:53,430
Speaker2: threat like that,

625
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,311
Speaker2: but just his

626
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:55,252
Speaker2: tone, the way he's talking

627
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:55,912
Speaker2: to me, yeah, I felt

628
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:56,273
Speaker2: very

629
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:56,953
Speaker2: uncomfortable.

630
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:58,134
Speaker2: I did not call the

631
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:58,735
Speaker2: police, but

632
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:00,156
Speaker2: at the moment I thought,

633
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:01,077
Speaker2: geez, I kinda wanna

634
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,078
Speaker2: call and file

635
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:02,979
Speaker2: a complaint that I

636
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:03,499
Speaker2: have somebody

637
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,420
Speaker2: who's,

638
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,262
Speaker2: who's threatening me,

639
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:06,265
Speaker2: not that they could do

640
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:07,147
Speaker2: anything, but that's

641
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:07,889
Speaker2: how I felt

642
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:08,470
Speaker2: the moment.

643
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:08,851
Speaker2: And

644
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:11,377
Speaker2: to be honest, I felt

645
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:12,219
Speaker2: a little uncomfortable over

646
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:12,981
Speaker2: the weekend. I thought,

647
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:13,743
Speaker2: Jesus, is he

648
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:14,465

00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:15,628
Speaker2: to my

00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,312
Speaker2: house?

652
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:18,237
Speaker2: You know, he

653
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,138
Speaker2: didn't, of course, but,

654
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,100
Speaker2: um,

655
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,162

659
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,126
Speaker1: I have to

660
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:24,567

724
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,402
Speaker2: out to

725
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:27,762
Speaker2: T.

726
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:28,723
Speaker2: Rock

727
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:30,626
Speaker2: was because

728
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,367
Speaker2: of his text

729
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:32,208
Speaker2: messages, and

730
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:32,889
Speaker2: he

731
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:33,650
Speaker2: started bombarding

732
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,452
Speaker2: everybody, and I

733
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:35,313
Speaker2: couldn't turn him off

734
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,515
Speaker2: in teams. He

735
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:36,675
Speaker2: was

736
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:37,536
Speaker2: just...

737
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:38,377
Speaker2: reaching out. And

738
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:38,697
Speaker2: so

739
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,460
Speaker2: my

740
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,281
Speaker2: concern was,

741
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,242
Speaker2: my main concern

742
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:43,143
Speaker2: was, I'm not sure if

743
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:43,383
Speaker2: he's

744
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:44,925
Speaker2: stable enough or

745
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:45,746
Speaker2: comfortable enough to

746
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,668
Speaker2: go into the stores,

747
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:47,769
Speaker2: right? Do we call

748
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:48,530
Speaker2: Costco and let him

749
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,331
Speaker2: know? Or I

750
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:50,232
Speaker2: didn't know how to handle that.

751
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:50,993
Speaker2: So I had reached out to

752
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:51,233
Speaker2: you,

753
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:52,615
Speaker2: Diana, because I

754
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:53,496
Speaker2: thought, I don't think you should

755
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:54,117
Speaker2: go into the store

756
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:54,878
Speaker2: because just

757
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,380
Speaker2: his unhappiness,

758
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,281
Speaker2: you know, I reached

759
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:57,862
Speaker2: out to Eric at

760
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:58,302
Speaker2: first.

761
00:12:58,723 --> 00:12:59,604
Speaker2: Unfortunately, he was on

762
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:00,365
Speaker2: a call, so he couldn't

763
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:01,226
Speaker2: get ahold of me. So,

764
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,547
Speaker2: so that was my, that

765
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:03,409
Speaker2: was my contact

766
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,029
Speaker2: for T-ROC.

767
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:04,570
Speaker2: Not

768
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:05,535
Speaker2: not

769
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:06,216
Speaker2: secondary,

770
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:07,138
Speaker2: not the first,

771
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:07,819
Speaker2: because I felt

772
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:08,480
Speaker2: uncomfortable.

773
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:09,882
Speaker2: First, I was like, how do

774
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:10,683
Speaker2: we handle this? What do

775
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:11,364
Speaker2: we do? I mean,

776
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:11,905
Speaker2: sending these

777
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:14,429
Speaker2: text

778
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,270
Speaker2: messages and

779
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,292
Speaker2: unhappiness.

780
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:16,572
Speaker2: He

781
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,017
Speaker2: wanted me to get on the

782
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:20,378
Speaker2: phone

783
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,740
Speaker2: with you, Cindy,

784
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:22,982
Speaker2: when I called him on

785
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:23,863
Speaker2: Friday. He's like, I want

786
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:24,604
Speaker2: you to get on the

787
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:25,105
Speaker2: phone. I

788
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:26,527
Speaker2: want to have a three-way

789
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:27,389
Speaker2: conversation with

790
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:27,990
Speaker2: Cindy. And I

791
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,971
Speaker2: said,

792
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:29,812
Speaker2: I can't not

793
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:30,693
Speaker2: have a three way. I mean,

794
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:31,254
Speaker2: let me give you the

795
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:31,995
Speaker2: contact number for

796
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:32,676
Speaker2: human resources.

797
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:33,497
Speaker2: That's the way to do

798
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:34,478
Speaker2: it. And he's like,

799
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:35,279
Speaker2: no, I want you to

800
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,580
Speaker2: get on the

801
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,001
Speaker2: phone

802
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,162
Speaker2: because she'd lied to

803
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:38,343
Speaker2: me,

804
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:39,704
Speaker2: you know, she lied

805
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:40,465
Speaker2: to me about full time

806
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,326
Speaker2: job, you know.

807
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:42,688
Speaker2: And so I need to get on

808
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,509
Speaker2: the phone with Cindy. And I

809
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:43,890
Speaker2: said,

810
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:44,831
Speaker2: the niche I

811
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:45,912
Speaker2: cannot get on the phone a

812
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:46,313
Speaker2: three way

813
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,194
Speaker2: with. That's

814
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:47,814
Speaker2: not how we handle

815
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:48,656
Speaker2: things. That's just

816
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:49,497
Speaker2: not the process. So let

817
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,057
Speaker2: me get you a

818
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:51,239
Speaker2: human resource

819
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,040
Speaker2: contact number.

820
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,761
Speaker2: But he was

821
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:53,622
Speaker2: very adamant

822
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:54,923
Speaker2: wanting to get on the phone with

823
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:55,564
Speaker2: me and Cindy.

824
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:56,085
Speaker2: And I

825
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,386
Speaker2: certainly wasn't

826
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:57,947
Speaker2: going to do that.

827
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:58,688
Speaker2: So

828
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:17,545
Speaker2: Oh, there's

829
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:17,906
Speaker2: everybody.

830
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:19,348
Speaker1: Nope.

831
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:19,929
Speaker1: Oh, I'm

832
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,430
Speaker1: sorry. I

833
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:21,793
Speaker1: was trying

834
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:22,634
Speaker1: to talk to Rargo.

835
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:23,556
Speaker1: Here's

836
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:24,438
Speaker1: here's my

837
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:24,919
Speaker1: current

838
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:25,660
Speaker1: concern

839
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:26,902
Speaker1: based on on

840
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:27,724
Speaker1: this new

841
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:28,305
Speaker1: statement of

842
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,046
Speaker1: facts here.

843
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:30,609
Speaker1: When you talk

844
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:31,531
Speaker1: with Diana on

845
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:32,573
Speaker1: Friday.

846
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:33,863
Speaker1: Diana

847
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:34,684
Speaker1: told you to

848
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:35,706
Speaker1: put this

849
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:36,748
Speaker1: incident into

850
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:36,888
Speaker1: the

851
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:37,770
Speaker1: investigation

852
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,551
Speaker1: smart sheet

853
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:39,793
Speaker1: and we

854
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:40,534
Speaker1: would

855
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:41,456
Speaker1: handle this

856
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:42,558
Speaker1: as an employee

857
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:43,018
Speaker1: relations

858
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:43,840
Speaker1: investigation,

859
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,521
Speaker1: which is what it

860
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:45,463
Speaker1: is if he's

861
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:46,264
Speaker1: spamming

862
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:47,165
Speaker1: the team's

863
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:48,007
Speaker1: chat and

864
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:48,768
Speaker1: saying

865
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:49,509
Speaker1: people lied to

866
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,010
Speaker1: him and

867
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,332
Speaker1: he wants to

868
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,134
Speaker1: talk back to his

869
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:52,715
Speaker1: recruiter.

870
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:53,957
Speaker1: That's the

871
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:54,758
Speaker1: proper way that

872
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:55,640
Speaker1: we normally would have

873
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,060
Speaker1: handled

874
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,042
Speaker1: that.

875
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:57,343
Speaker1: In

876
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,145
Speaker1: response

877
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:59,068
Speaker1: to that, what

878
00:14:59,128 --> 00:14:59,690
Speaker1: you told

879
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,432
Speaker1: Diana

880
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:01,114
Speaker1: was

881
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:01,896
Speaker1: that you were

882
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:02,739
Speaker1: afraid for your

883
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,521
Speaker1: safety and

884
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:04,263
Speaker1: were going to

885
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:04,725
Speaker1: call the

886
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:05,547
Speaker1: police.

887
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,068
Speaker1: That

888
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,050
Speaker1: triggers

889
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,891
Speaker1: an entirely

890
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:09,351
Speaker1: different

891
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:10,112
Speaker1: response

892
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,074
Speaker1: and caused us to

893
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:11,554
Speaker1: put this

894
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:12,555
Speaker1: employee in an

895
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:13,977
Speaker1: out

896
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:14,678
Speaker1: of work

897
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:15,740
Speaker1: status. And

898
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,661
Speaker1: we did so without

899
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,181
Speaker1: pay

900
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,904
Speaker1: pursuant

901
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:19,705
Speaker1: to the California

902
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:20,526
Speaker1: statute that would

903
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,407
Speaker1: have allowed us to

904
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:22,268
Speaker1: do that for a

905
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:22,849
Speaker1: person

906
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:23,610
Speaker1: who was

907
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,351
Speaker1: threatening

908
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:25,112
Speaker1: harm or

909
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,013
Speaker1: violence.

910
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:26,133
Speaker1: And

911
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:27,174
Speaker1: today

912
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:27,234
Speaker1: he

913
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:30,098
Speaker1: wasn't

914
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,039
Speaker1: doing any of those

915
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:31,720
Speaker1: things.

916
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:34,909
Speaker2: Well, I never

917
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:35,811
Speaker2: indicated to

918
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,033
Speaker2: Diana that.

919
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:38,695
Speaker1: No, you told her you were

920
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:39,497
Speaker1: going to, you wanted to

921
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:39,817
Speaker1: call the

922
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:40,859
Speaker1: police.

923
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,680
Speaker2: Yeah. Cause that's how

924
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,181
Speaker2: I felt.

925
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:43,503
Speaker2: Like if you, if

926
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:43,744
Speaker2: you,

927
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,106
Speaker2: if you talk to him

928
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:45,987
Speaker2: or, you know, if

929
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:46,809
Speaker2: you were on the phone with him,

930
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:47,810
Speaker2: yeah, I

931
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,371
Speaker2: felt very

932
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:49,393
Speaker2: uncomfortable. It was

933
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:49,894
Speaker2: scary.

934
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,216
Speaker2: So when I was

935
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,097
Speaker2: talking to Dana, that,

936
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:53,019
Speaker2: that was my emotional

937
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:53,600
Speaker2: reaction.

938
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:54,542
Speaker2: Um,

939
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:55,463
Speaker2: but.

940
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:58,062
Speaker2: And the reason why I

941
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:58,783
Speaker2: was calling Human

942
00:15:58,844 --> 00:15:59,484
Speaker2: Resources or

943
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:00,766
Speaker2: I was calling

944
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:01,688
Speaker2: Diana for this

945
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:02,589
Speaker2: was

946
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,410
Speaker2: for

947
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:04,893
Speaker2: mainly, or the first

948
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:05,654
Speaker2: part of it was

949
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:05,974
Speaker2: his,

950
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:07,637
Speaker2: as you mentioned in

951
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:08,358
Speaker2: the email,

952
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:09,239
Speaker2: Diana, the

953
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,301
Speaker2: inflammatory,

954
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,883
Speaker2: discriminatory

955
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:12,785
Speaker2: and disruptive to the

956
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:13,686
Speaker2: workplace emails.

957
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:15,849
Speaker2: That was the reason why

958
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:16,090
Speaker2: I was

959
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,372
Speaker2: originally reaching out

960
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,173
Speaker2: to you guys, right?

961
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:19,034
Speaker2: Because like, here, we have a

962
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:19,895
Speaker2: situation here where

963
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:20,336
Speaker2: we have an

964
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:21,578
Speaker2: employee that is

965
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,280
Speaker2: sending these text

966
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:24,302
Speaker2: messages.

967
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:25,668
Speaker1: Right, and we have a

968
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,529
Speaker1: protocol for how

969
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,390
Speaker1: we handle that.

970
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:29,232
Speaker2: But it would not have

971
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:30,013
Speaker1: entailed him.

972
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:30,734
Speaker1: Okay,

973
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:31,515
Speaker1: so

974
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:32,656
Speaker1: here's what

975
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:33,317
Speaker1: we're gonna do.

976
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:34,879
Speaker2: Diana,

977
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,660
Speaker2: they're

978
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,301
Speaker2: gonna pay him

979
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:36,721
Speaker2: for

980
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:37,602
Speaker1: whatever his

981
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:38,563
Speaker1: scheduled days would

982
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,404
Speaker1: have been that we told

983
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:40,005
Speaker1: him he couldn't

984
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:40,906
Speaker1: work.

985
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:41,707
Speaker1: We're gonna pay him for

986
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:42,368
Speaker1: those days.

987
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,750
Speaker1: We are going to

988
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,711
Speaker1: address that he

989
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:45,572
Speaker1: has to use

990
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:46,192
Speaker1: our

991
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:46,933
Speaker1: teens

992
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:47,334
Speaker1: and

993
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,455
Speaker1: intranet

994
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,057
Speaker1: in accordance with

995
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:50,938
Speaker1: our policy, which

996
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:51,359
Speaker1: means

997
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,500
Speaker1: respect

998
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:54,688
Speaker1: that, you know,

999
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,162
Speaker1: what the policy

1000
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:56,989
Speaker1: requires.

1001
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:02,192
Speaker1: he needs

1002
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:03,133
Speaker1: to be respectful and

1003
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:03,794
Speaker1: we can

1004
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:04,314
Speaker1: certainly

1005
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:04,855
Speaker1: address

1006
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:05,996
Speaker1: the issue of

1007
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:06,737
Speaker1: respect

1008
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,419
Speaker1: and being

1009
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:10,120
Speaker1: courteous to

1010
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,680
Speaker1: others

1011
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:11,241
Speaker1: and

1012
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,422
Speaker1: that

1013
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:12,702
Speaker1: it's

1014
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:14,624
Speaker1: inappropriate

1015
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:15,545
Speaker1: to spam a

1016
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,006
Speaker1: group chat with

1017
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:17,947
Speaker1: messages directed to

1018
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:18,408
Speaker1: particular

1019
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:19,189
Speaker1: individuals that

1020
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:20,189
Speaker1: he can reach out

1021
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,850
Speaker1: directly to those

1022
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,651
Speaker1: individuals or

1023
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:22,051
Speaker1: he can

1024
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,593
Speaker1: reach out to HR

1025
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:24,213
Speaker1: and how he can

1026
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,134
Speaker1: submit a complaint to

1027
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:25,895
Speaker1: HR, but he

1028
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,356
Speaker1: can't

1029
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,177
Speaker1: do what he's been

1030
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,018
Speaker1: doing.

1031
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:31,196
Speaker1: But

1032
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:31,897
Speaker1: I think we

1033
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:32,678
Speaker1: do have

1034
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:33,940
Speaker1: to

1035
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:35,442
Speaker1: retract that

1036
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:35,983
Speaker1: he was

1037
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,185
Speaker1: threatening because

1038
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:37,986
Speaker1: this just doesn't

1039
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:39,769
Speaker1: get us to the level

1040
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:40,670
Speaker1: we need to in order

1041
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,291
Speaker1: to send him home

1042
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:41,972
Speaker1: without pay

1043
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:42,833
Speaker1: in California

1044
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:43,254
Speaker1: under those

1045
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:44,135
Speaker1: circumstances.

1046
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:46,599
Speaker2: the

1047
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,820
Speaker2: original reason I was

1048
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,561
Speaker2: reaching out to

1049
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:49,262
Speaker2: Diana was

1050
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:50,424
Speaker2: because again,

1051
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,145
Speaker2: those text

1052
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:51,946
Speaker2: messages and

1053
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:52,407
Speaker2: like

1054
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,149
Speaker2: you know, because he was spending

1055
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:54,989
Speaker2: everybody and he started

1056
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:55,610
Speaker2: texting the group,

1057
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,491
Speaker2: whatever, you know,

1058
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,492
Speaker2: and I'm like, I don't think

1059
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:58,012
Speaker2: he's in the right

1060
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:58,933
Speaker2: mindset to go

1061
00:17:58,973 --> 00:17:59,794
Speaker2: to work. I

1062
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:00,274
Speaker2: can even have a

1063
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,035
Speaker2: conversation with him

1064
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:01,756
Speaker2: anymore, right?

1065
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:02,656
Speaker2: I think all of

1066
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:03,577
Speaker2: us spoke with him.

1067
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:04,938
Speaker2: Now the email you sent

1068
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:05,819
Speaker2: out, Diana, which

1069
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,960
Speaker2: to me, honestly, I

1070
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,301
Speaker2: looked

1071
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,042
Speaker2: at it when you sent out

1072
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:10,503
Speaker2: under the, I

1073
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:11,284
Speaker2: think you mentioned

1074
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:11,764
Speaker2: California

1075
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:12,625
Speaker2: SB553,

1076
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:14,527
Speaker2: which sounds

1077
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:15,248
Speaker2: to me like it's a pretty

1078
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,068
Speaker2: serious, you

1079
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:16,929
Speaker2: know, documentation

1080
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:17,229
Speaker2: wise,

1081
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,691
Speaker2: I guess it would have,

1082
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:19,772
Speaker2: if I was gonna go to

1083
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,452
Speaker2: that level,

1084
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,313
Speaker2: then,

1085
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,578
Speaker2: It seems like maybe

1086
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:23,219
Speaker2: the

1087
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,121
Speaker2: conversation should have

1088
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:24,642
Speaker2: taken with me

1089
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:25,123
Speaker2: first.

1090
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,146
Speaker2: Well, Gerardo, let me tell you

1091
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:27,807
Speaker2: exactly what

1092
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:28,468
Speaker2: transpired.

1093
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:29,710
Speaker2: Because when I spoke to you,

1094
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,472
Speaker2: Danana, I was just

1095
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:31,373
Speaker2: telling you how I was feeling

1096
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:31,974
Speaker2: emotionally at the

1097
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:32,896
Speaker2: time. I just

1098
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,777
Speaker2: got off the phone with him. It

1099
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:33,958
Speaker2: was

1100
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:35,240
Speaker2: just

1101
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,161
Speaker2: scary,

1102
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:36,882
Speaker2: uncomfortable,

1103
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:37,423
Speaker2: way

1104
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:39,487
Speaker2: uncomfortable.

1105
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:40,489
Speaker2: Well,

1106
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,570
Speaker2: Gerardo,

1107
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:42,632
Speaker1: I'm going to say

1108
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:43,133
Speaker1: this.

1109
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,533
Speaker2: Cause then I feel

1110
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:45,213
Speaker2: like I'm

1111
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,395
Speaker1: the first level

1112
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:47,376
Speaker1: field manager.

1113
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,258
Speaker1: I might

1114
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:50,098
Speaker1: give you that, but

1115
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:50,799
Speaker1: when someone at

1116
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,480
Speaker1: your level

1117
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,641
Speaker1: says things

1118
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:54,643
Speaker1: like what you

1119
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:55,384
Speaker1: said, that is

1120
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:56,345
Speaker1: in fact going

1121
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:57,186
Speaker1: to trigger a very

1122
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:57,686
Speaker1: serious

1123
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:58,467
Speaker1: response. And

1124
00:18:58,547 --> 00:18:59,388
Speaker1: you did see

1125
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:00,169
Speaker1: the email. And if

1126
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:00,990
Speaker1: that was not the

1127
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,490
Speaker1: case, you

1128
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:02,551
Speaker1: absolutely could

1129
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:02,992
Speaker1: have said,

1130
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:03,653
Speaker1: Hey,

1131
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:04,413
Speaker1: hold on. I

1132
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:05,354
Speaker1: think that's stronger

1133
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:06,275
Speaker1: than what I wanted. And

1134
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,116
Speaker1: I'm sure Diana

1135
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,057
Speaker1: also told you

1136
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:08,838
Speaker1: at that

1137
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,699
Speaker1: time that she was

1138
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:10,620
Speaker1: going to remove him

1139
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,481
Speaker1: from the schedule

1140
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:12,982
Speaker1: because he was being

1141
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:13,643
Speaker1: threatened.

1142
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:16,039
Speaker2: I don't remember the

1143
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:16,359
Speaker2: exact

1144
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,120
Speaker2: conversation. I

1145
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:19,804
Speaker2: knew she was, she said she was

1146
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:20,625
Speaker2: in a room, but I'm

1147
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,446
Speaker2: like, well, yeah, she was in a

1148
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,347
Speaker2: room because I was

1149
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:23,889
Speaker2: responding with his

1150
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,311
Speaker2: comments and it doesn't

1151
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:25,691
Speaker2: seem like

1152
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:26,292
Speaker2: an

1153
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,053
Speaker2: employee who should be

1154
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:27,674
Speaker2: going to work,

1155
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:28,855
Speaker2: you know, by

1156
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,496
Speaker2: all the

1157
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:30,277
Speaker2: discrimination

1158
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:31,038
Speaker2: emails and

1159
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:32,380
Speaker2: unhappy with everybody,

1160
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:32,880
Speaker2: you know,

1161
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,942
Speaker2: slamming.

1162
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:34,602
Speaker2: We don't tell

1163
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:35,243
Speaker2: employees they

1164
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:36,164
Speaker1: can't come to work because

1165
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:37,045
Speaker1: they tell us that,

1166
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:37,907
Speaker1: because they

1167
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:38,507
Speaker1: complain about

1168
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,449
Speaker1: discrimination. Cause that's

1169
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,089
Speaker1: what you call it.

1170
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,511
Speaker1: right

1171
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,170
Speaker1: So no, we

1172
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,991
Speaker1: would not have removed

1173
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:45,792
Speaker1: him from the schedule

1174
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:46,673
Speaker2: for that and that's not

1175
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:46,813
Speaker2: a

1176
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:47,414
Speaker1: basis

1177
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,495
Speaker1: for removing

1178
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,097
Speaker1: schedule.

1179
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:51,118
Speaker1: Am I left?

1180
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:51,959
Speaker1: No.

1181
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,603
Speaker1: Diana,

1182
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:55,504
Speaker1: unmute yourself, hon.

1183
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:58,928
Speaker2: So you're saying with

1184
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,729
Speaker2: all those

1185
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:00,530
Speaker2: emails that he had sent

1186
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,551
Speaker2: out, he still would

1187
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:02,192
Speaker2: have been able to go to

1188
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:02,512
Speaker2: work?

1189
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:04,655
Speaker1: Yes, he would have been

1190
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:05,476
Speaker1: able to go to work.

1191
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,236
Speaker1: He was removed from

1192
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:06,917
Speaker1: work because you

1193
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:07,798
Speaker1: told her that the

1194
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:08,759
Speaker1: threats were of such

1195
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,320
Speaker1: a level and

1196
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,941
Speaker1: quality

1197
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:11,162
Speaker1: that it warranted

1198
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:11,563
Speaker1: police

1199
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:12,604
Speaker1: intervention.

1200
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,270
Speaker2: I didn't tell her I

1201
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,551
Speaker2: needed,

1202
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,153
Speaker2: I told her how I was

1203
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,054
Speaker2: feeling, but I didn't say

1204
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:17,295
Speaker2: like,

1205
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:20,119
Speaker2: anything words like,

1206
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:20,860
Speaker2: oh, he's

1207
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:21,261
Speaker2: gonna

1208
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:22,523
Speaker2: drive

1209
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:22,884
Speaker2: down and

1210
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:23,965
Speaker2: cause any

1211
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:25,027
Speaker2: personal harm.

1212
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,209
Speaker2: I was just telling Diana

1213
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:26,990
Speaker2: how I was feeling at the

1214
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,811
Speaker2: time, but for me, my

1215
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,492
Speaker2: biggest concern

1216
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:28,753
Speaker2: was,

1217
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:30,235
Speaker2: we can't have someone like

1218
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:31,136
Speaker2: this go in the store.

1219
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:33,720
Speaker2: I even told our

1220
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:34,722
Speaker2: account manager, do we

1221
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:35,123
Speaker2: need

1222
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:36,565
Speaker2: to

1223
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:37,426
Speaker2: call Costco

1224
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:37,907
Speaker2: and let him

1225
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:38,608
Speaker2: know?

1226
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:39,598
Speaker2: you know, that we have,

1227
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:40,419
Speaker2: we have an individual

1228
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,059
Speaker2: here that is

1229
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,060
Speaker2: extremely

1230
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,861
Speaker2: upset who just

1231
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:43,322
Speaker2: told me in

1232
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:44,703
Speaker2: the chat,

1233
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:45,544
Speaker2: right? If

1234
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:45,864
Speaker2: there's any

1235
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:46,645
Speaker2: discrimination in

1236
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:47,165
Speaker2: Gerardo,

1237
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,046
Speaker2: I'm

1238
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:48,607
Speaker2: going to go

1239
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:49,207
Speaker2: and I'm

1240
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,049
Speaker2: going to go

1241
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:51,830
Speaker2: and call

1242
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,531
Speaker2: Bose and

1243
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:53,472
Speaker2: Costco.

1244
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:53,892
Speaker2: And that

1245
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,493
Speaker2: comment,

1246
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:55,614
Speaker2: that was pretty,

1247
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:56,294
Speaker1: to sue

1248
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:56,855
Speaker1: you and

1249
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:57,796
Speaker1: report you if

1250
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:58,617
Speaker1: you discriminate

1251
00:20:58,677 --> 00:20:59,518
Speaker1: against me, which are

1252
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:00,378
Speaker1: things that he

1253
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:00,839
Speaker1: has the

1254
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,480
Speaker1: legal

1255
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,420
Speaker1: right

1256
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,022
Speaker1: to do.

1257
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:05,198
Speaker1: And it

1258
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:05,739
Speaker1: is

1259
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:06,540
Speaker1: illegal

1260
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,361
Speaker1: to take

1261
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:07,901
Speaker1: adverse

1262
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:08,842
Speaker1: actions against

1263
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:09,323
Speaker1: him for

1264
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:09,984
Speaker1: asserting

1265
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:10,504
Speaker1: those

1266
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:10,945
Speaker1: rights.

1267
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:12,346
Speaker1: So under no

1268
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:13,307
Speaker1: circumstances

1269
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:14,208
Speaker1: would any member

1270
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:15,129
Speaker1: of my team have

1271
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:15,970
Speaker1: told you that they

1272
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,691
Speaker1: would remove

1273
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,271
Speaker1: him from

1274
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,092
Speaker1: work for

1275
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:18,993
Speaker1: those reasons.

1276
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:20,655
Speaker1: We would have done

1277
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:21,496
Speaker1: exactly what

1278
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:21,976
Speaker1: Diana

1279
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:22,917
Speaker1: initially told

1280
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:23,578
Speaker1: you, which was

1281
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:24,038
Speaker1: tell you,

1282
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,180
Speaker1: we will start an

1283
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,121
Speaker1: investigation

1284
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,002
Speaker1: and get a

1285
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:27,782
Speaker1: response

1286
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:28,323
Speaker1: to him,

1287
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:29,544
Speaker1: not

1288
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,245
Speaker1: immediately

1289
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:31,186
Speaker1: remove him from the

1290
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,187
Speaker1: store.

1291
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,038
Speaker1: If I sound a

1292
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:34,418
Speaker1: bit

1293
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,300
Speaker1: frustrated and

1294
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,121
Speaker1: upset right now,

1295
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:37,404
Speaker1: I am because this is

1296
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:37,924
Speaker1: a big deal.

1297
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:39,948
Speaker2: Oh, no,

1298
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:40,810
Speaker2: I'm very

1299
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,611
Speaker2: frustrated as well.

1300
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:42,292
Speaker2: And I'm not really

1301
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:42,893
Speaker2: happy right now

1302
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:43,294
Speaker2: because

1303
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,977
Speaker2: now it's being turned

1304
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:45,638
Speaker2: against me.

1305
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:47,121
Speaker2: Like,

1306
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:48,343
Speaker2: here you have an

1307
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:48,904
Speaker2: employee,

1308
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:50,547
Speaker2: right,

1309
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:51,729
Speaker2: who is

1310
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,450
Speaker2: conducting himself in

1311
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:53,252
Speaker2: a very appropriate

1312
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:54,133
Speaker2: manner, in an

1313
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:55,035
Speaker2: appropriate way.

1314
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:56,387
Speaker2: I'm not a

1315
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:57,248
Speaker2: manager, or I'm

1316
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:58,169
Speaker2: not his direct manager.

1317
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,010
Speaker2: Obviously I was stepping

1318
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,991
Speaker2: in to help. He reports

1319
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:00,772
Speaker2: to one of the

1320
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,253
Speaker2: FMs,

1321
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:02,294
Speaker2: right?

1322
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,055
Speaker2: And

1323
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,395
Speaker2: so

1324
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:04,777
Speaker2: here I called Diana.

1325
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:05,597
Speaker2: Hey, Diana, here we

1326
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:05,878
Speaker2: have an

1327
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:06,779
Speaker2: employee

1328
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,139
Speaker2: who's,

1329
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,061
Speaker2: you saw his emails

1330
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:09,842
Speaker2: and texting

1331
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:10,303
Speaker2: everybody,

1332
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,163
Speaker2: you know,

1333
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:12,485
Speaker2: trying

1334
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,086
Speaker2: to find every

1335
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:13,926
Speaker2: possible chat he was

1336
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:14,227
Speaker2: in. And

1337
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:15,869
Speaker2: I'm thinking, I don't

1338
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:16,709
Speaker2: think he's right to go

1339
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,550
Speaker2: into the store.

1340
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,371
Speaker2: So when Diana

1341
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:19,312
Speaker2: pulled them, I'm like, well,

1342
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:20,193
Speaker2: that makes sense. Let's

1343
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,054
Speaker2: review this and

1344
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:21,314
Speaker2: be like,

1345
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:22,976
Speaker2: is he right to go to the

1346
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:23,757
Speaker2: store?

1347
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,101
Speaker2: And with Dan, I shared

1348
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,023
Speaker2: how I was feeling. Now,

1349
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:26,864
Speaker2: if you are gonna send an

1350
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:27,726
Speaker2: email to him and

1351
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:28,126
Speaker2: say, hey,

1352
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,168

Speaker2: SB553,

00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:34,918
Speaker2: Then yeah, of course,

1355
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,659
Speaker2: then I would have

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,300
Speaker2: followed up with me to

1357
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,242
Speaker2: confirm if it's gonna

1358
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:38,103
Speaker2: be this serious.

1359
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:39,526
Speaker2: So

Speaker1: and I said, Latasha, this

1409
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:32,706

Speaker1: schedule?

1415
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,173
Speaker1: This is not something that

1416
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:39,994
Speaker1: we take lightly.

1417
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:42,256

00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:05,494
Speaker1: this

1496
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,455
Speaker1: employee is

1497
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:07,116
Speaker1: violating

1498
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:07,497
Speaker1: our

1499
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:08,098
Speaker1: workplace

1500
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:08,739
Speaker1: violence

1501
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,480
Speaker1: policy.

1502
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:10,662
Speaker1: And we need to

1503
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:11,463
Speaker1: call the police.

1504
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:11,924
Speaker1: There's a

1505
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,026
Speaker1: long,

1506
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:14,368
Speaker1: there's a big

1507
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:15,189
Speaker1: difference between

1508
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:15,810
Speaker1: those things.

1509
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:16,751
Speaker1: And it's a big

1510
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:17,693
Speaker1: difference between the

1511
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:18,394
Speaker1: employee is

1512
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:19,055
Speaker1: angry

1513
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:19,756
Speaker1: and,

1514
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:20,978
Speaker1: and

1515
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:25,352
Speaker1: Seriously,

1516
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:28,875
Speaker1: as

1517
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:29,616
Speaker1: you pointed out,

1518
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:30,116
Speaker1: you're

1519
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:30,977
Speaker1: his

1520
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:31,757
Speaker1: manager's

1521
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:32,919
Speaker1: manager. At

1522
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,279
Speaker1: that

1523
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,220
Speaker1: level,

1524
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:35,781
Speaker1: some

1525
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:36,942
Speaker1: expectation,

1526
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:37,543
Speaker1: I guess,

1527
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:38,063
Speaker1: of

1528
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:39,805
Speaker1: ability to

1529
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:40,585
Speaker1: separate and

1530
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:41,486
Speaker1: recognize

1531
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,307
Speaker1: that, hey, this

1532
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:43,088
Speaker1: person is

1533
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:43,408
Speaker1: being

1534
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:44,249
Speaker1: inappropriate,

1535
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,630
Speaker1: and they're angry, and

1536
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,430
Speaker1: perhaps I'm not

1537
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:46,851
Speaker1: able to

1538
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:47,732
Speaker1: communicate with

1539
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:48,612
Speaker1: them, but we do

1540
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:49,533
Speaker1: need to address their

1541
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:50,274
Speaker1: inappropriate

1542
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:50,995
Speaker1: behavior.

1543
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:51,815
Speaker1: But

1544
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:52,776
Speaker1: Gerardo,

1545
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:53,557
Speaker1: when you

1546
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:54,880
Speaker1: They

1547
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,541
Speaker1: were

1548
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:56,383
Speaker1: like,

1549
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:57,805
Speaker1: I feel like I

1550
00:25:58,045 --> 00:25:58,886
Speaker1: need to call

1551
00:25:58,926 --> 00:25:59,567
Speaker1: the police.

1552
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:01,149
Speaker2: Yeah.

1553
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,251
Speaker2: Did I say I'm going

1554
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,012
Speaker2: to call the police?

1555
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:03,913
Speaker2: No, I said,

1556
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:04,614
Speaker2: I feel like I need

1557
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:05,856
Speaker1: any member of my

1558
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:06,797
Speaker1: team that does not

1559
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:07,619
Speaker1: do what she did

1560
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,460
Speaker1: in response to

1561
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,860
Speaker1: someone

1562
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,441
Speaker1: saying

1563
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:10,623
Speaker1: that they feel like

1564
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:11,464
Speaker1: they need to call the

1565
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:12,265
Speaker1: police because they are

1566
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:12,706
Speaker1: afraid of an

1567
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:13,547
Speaker1: employee would be

1568
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,069
Speaker1: unemployed

1569
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:15,931
Speaker1: on Monday if they

00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,632
Speaker1: did not take those

1571
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:17,593
Speaker1: actions on Friday.

1572
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:20,717
Speaker2: Yeah, I wish we had the caller

1573
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:21,599
Speaker2: recording because, uh, Dana,

1574
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,440
Speaker2: did I say I'm going to call

1575
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,262
Speaker2: the police? No, I said, I

1576
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:23,923
Speaker2: feel like I should

1577
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,004
Speaker2: call the police the

1578
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:25,565
Speaker2: way he's talking

1579
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:26,787
Speaker1: Gerardo,

1580
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:27,829
Speaker1: someone saying

1581
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:28,731
Speaker1: they feel

1582
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:29,692
Speaker1: like they need

1583
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:30,494
Speaker1: to call the police,

1584
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:31,415
Speaker1: whether you do it

1585
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,096
Speaker1: or not,

1586
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:33,739
Speaker1: personal choice.

1587
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,140
Speaker1: Whether you

1588
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,641
Speaker2: do it,

1589
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:35,202
Speaker2: you

1590
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:36,123
Speaker1: indicate that

1591
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:36,524
Speaker1: this is

1592
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:37,265
Speaker1: serious

1593
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:38,046
Speaker1: enough for the

1594
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:38,768
Speaker1: police to be

1595
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,649
Speaker1: involved.

1596
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:41,315
Speaker1: That's a

1597
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:42,256
Speaker1: very serious

1598
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:43,177
Speaker1: allegation that is

1599
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:43,978
Speaker1: materially

1600
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:44,579
Speaker1: different from

1601
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:45,460
Speaker1: someone telling you,

1602
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,381
Speaker1: I'm going to sue

1603
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,282

Speaker1: say that?

1610
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,290
Speaker2: So Latasha, then

1611
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,011

1612
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:54,852
Speaker2: called in to

1613
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:55,553

Speaker2: wasn't.

1658
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:41,593

Speaker1: not.

1665
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,361
Speaker1: I am not

1666
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:50,482
Speaker1: because you're not

1667
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,304
Speaker1: denying that you

1668
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:52,185

Speaker1: now is

1672
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:55,509
Speaker1: going back on the

1673
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,291
Speaker1: context.

1674
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,113
Speaker1: And what I'm not

1675
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:58,954
Speaker1: going to turn this

1676
00:27:59,115 --> 00:27:59,535
Speaker1: into

00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:00,256
Speaker1: is a

1678
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:01,057
Speaker1: situation

1679
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:01,698
Speaker1: where

1680
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:02,559
Speaker1: you think

1681
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,601
Speaker1: that us doing

1682
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,442
Speaker1: our jobs

1683
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:05,383
Speaker1: and responding

1684
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:06,245
Speaker1: to the words that you

1685
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:07,166
Speaker1: say is somehow

1686
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,067
Speaker1: inappropriate.

1687
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:09,149
Speaker1: And no,

1688
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:09,810
Speaker1: we

1689
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,070
Speaker1: would

1690
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:11,432
Speaker1: never.

1691
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:11,852
Speaker1: make

1692
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:12,453
Speaker1: someone

1693
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,214
Speaker1: go through

1694
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:13,914
Speaker1: hoops to

1695
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:14,475
Speaker1: report a

1696
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:15,356
Speaker1: safety issue,

1697
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:16,396
Speaker1: meaning you're not going

1698
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,217
Speaker1: to have to talk to my

1699
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:17,898
Speaker1: men to an

1700
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:18,979
Speaker1: HR BP,

1701
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:20,220
Speaker1: then the manager

1702
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,021
Speaker1: and then me.

1703
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:23,483
Speaker1: But there is an

1704
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:24,444
Speaker1: expectation

1705
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,665
Speaker1: that,

1706
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:26,746
Speaker1: that our

1707
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:27,747
Speaker1: senior level

1708
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:28,628
Speaker1: of managers

1709
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:29,909
Speaker1: mean the

1710
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:30,709
Speaker1: words that are

1711
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:31,570
Speaker1: coming out of their

1712
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,171
Speaker1: mouth in the

1713
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:32,951
Speaker1: context in

1714
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,772
Speaker1: which they say.

1715
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:38,596
Speaker2: Unbelievable.

1716
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:39,717
Speaker2: Yeah, I don't

1717
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:40,598
Speaker2: know. Yeah, it is

1718
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:41,419
Speaker1: unbelievable.

1719
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:42,736
Speaker2: I think the

1720
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:44,780
Speaker2: tone of

1721
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,621
Speaker2: this conversation,

1722
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:45,721
Speaker2: I'm

1723
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:47,224
Speaker2: just very surprised.

1724
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:47,825
Speaker2: I feel like

1725
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:48,927
Speaker2: here I'm trying to

1726
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:49,588
Speaker2: protect

1727
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,110
Speaker2: the store,

1728
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,272
Speaker2: the team,

1729
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:53,715
Speaker2: this guy sending these,

1730
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:56,379
Speaker2: emailing me

1731
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:57,000
Speaker2: discrimination

1732
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,461
Speaker2: emails,

1733
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:58,603
Speaker2: which we all read,

1734
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,266
Speaker2: which

1735
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:01,187
Speaker2: I was happy he was out. We

1736
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:01,748
Speaker2: were all like,

1737
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:02,589
Speaker2: wow, he's out.

1738
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:03,471
Speaker2: Cause yeah, he's

1739
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:04,392
Speaker2: not ready to go to the store.

1740
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:05,314
Speaker2: I couldn't even talk to him.

1741
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,155
Speaker1: Because you told her

1742
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:06,937
Speaker1: that he was a

1743
00:29:07,017 --> 00:29:07,477
Speaker1: threat for

1744
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:08,419
Speaker1: violence.

1745
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,271
Speaker1: And right now

1746
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:13,912
Speaker1: it really

1747
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,134
Speaker1: sounds

1748
00:29:15,194 --> 00:29:16,015
Speaker1: like you knew

1749
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:16,816
Speaker1: that she

1750
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:17,678
Speaker1: wasn't going to send

1751
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:18,579
Speaker1: him home based on what

1752
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:19,180
Speaker1: you told her.

1753
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,522
Speaker1: And you came up with the

1754
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:21,323
Speaker1: magic words to

1755
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:22,244
Speaker1: trigger that so that

1756
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:22,665
Speaker1: we would be

1757
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:23,406
Speaker1: required to

1758
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:24,067
Speaker1: send him home.

1759
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:25,710
Speaker2: That's really what

1760
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,611
Speaker1: it's sounding like

1761
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:27,092
Speaker1: right now.

1762
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:28,594
Speaker2: I'm just going to be

1763
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:29,515
Speaker1: honest. That's

1764
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,337
Speaker1: the impression I'm

1765
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,138
Speaker1: getting. And

1766
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:31,578
Speaker1: especially

1767
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:32,340
Speaker2: now that you want to

1768
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,680
Speaker2: throw it

1769
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,561
Speaker1: back and hold on

1770
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:34,643
Speaker1: now.

1771
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:35,649
Speaker1: that you want

1772
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:36,571
Speaker1: to deflect back

1773
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,312
Speaker1: and try to say that

1774
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:37,832
Speaker1: somehow

1775
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:38,914
Speaker1: we should have

1776
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:39,915
Speaker1: followed up with you

1777
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:40,697
Speaker1: to see if you really

1778
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:41,357
Speaker1: meant what you

1779
00:29:41,418 --> 00:29:41,878
Speaker1: told us

1780
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,020
Speaker1: the first time.

1781
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:45,564
Speaker1: Make it make

1782
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:47,026
Speaker1: sense.

1783
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:47,607
Speaker2: Wait, so you're

1784
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:48,308
Speaker2: saying that I

1785
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:49,169
Speaker2: said that I didn't

1786
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:49,449
Speaker2: think

1787
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:50,190
Speaker2: his

1788
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:50,691
Speaker2: email

1789
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:52,474
Speaker2: wasn't sufficient enough

1790
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:52,854
Speaker2: to send him

1791
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:53,475
Speaker2: home.

1792
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,467
Speaker2: So you said that I

1793
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:56,188
Speaker2: decided-

1794
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:56,909
Speaker2: Diana told

1795
00:29:56,949 --> 00:29:57,731
Speaker1: you it was not,

1796
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:58,652
Speaker1: Diana told

1797
00:29:58,712 --> 00:29:59,573
Speaker1: you to

1798
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,535
Speaker1: put that on the

1799
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:01,296
Speaker1: smart sheet

1800
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:01,636
Speaker1: for an

1801
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,658
Speaker1: investigation

1802
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:03,759
Speaker1: and we would have done an

1803
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,621
Speaker1: employee relations

1804
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:05,562
Speaker1: investigation.

1805
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:07,164
Speaker1: That's what she

1806
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:07,805
Speaker1: instructed

1807
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:08,687
Speaker1: you to do.

1808
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,350
Speaker2: instructed- I didn't want to

1809
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,172
Speaker2: be clear where you just said

1810
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,013
Speaker2: LaTosha, because that's

1811
00:30:13,073 --> 00:30:13,934
Speaker2: huge. And

1812
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:14,795
Speaker2: Jerry and Dinah, you're

1813
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:15,336
Speaker2: on the call.

1814
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,638
Speaker2: You just said that

1815
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,841
Speaker2: by his tone of

1816
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,763
Speaker2: language, it wasn't going to

1817
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:20,644
Speaker2: be enough

1818
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,228
Speaker2: to send them home,

1819
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:23,610
Speaker2: so then I made

1820
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,411
Speaker2: up and

1821
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:24,931
Speaker2: came up

1822
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:27,474
Speaker2: with the thing that he-

1823
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,015
Speaker2: I'm saying that the

1824
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:28,496
Speaker2: sequence

1825
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:29,277
Speaker1: of facts

1826
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:30,178
Speaker1: and

1827
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:31,159
Speaker1: hear

1828
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:31,439
Speaker1: me,

1829
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,480
Speaker1: we can

1830
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:33,361
Speaker1: investigate that if

1831
00:30:33,402 --> 00:30:34,223
Speaker1: you prefer, but I'm

1832
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:34,823
Speaker1: saying that the

1833
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:35,364
Speaker1: sequence of

1834
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:35,865
Speaker1: events

1835
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:39,229
Speaker1: just does not,

1836
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:40,250
Speaker1: this context,

1837
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,151
Speaker1: Gerardo, just really

1838
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:41,672
Speaker1: doesn't look

1839
00:30:41,712 --> 00:30:42,092
Speaker1: good.

1840
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:43,397
Speaker1: And

1841
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,741
Speaker1: especially

1842
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:45,322
Speaker2: when,

1843
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:46,505
Speaker2: because you're not

1844
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:47,448
Speaker1: standing, you're

1845
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:48,210
Speaker1: not standing by

1846
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,032
Speaker1: what you said

1847
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:49,994
Speaker1: to Diana on

1848
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:51,719
Speaker1: Friday.

1849
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,521
Speaker1: And now

1850
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:53,283
Speaker1: there's a walk

1851
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:54,245
Speaker1: back to the

1852
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,007
Speaker1: severity of

1853
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:55,408
Speaker1: what

1854
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:56,491
Speaker1: happened when

1855
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:57,213
Speaker1: we say, Hey,

1856
00:30:57,694 --> 00:30:58,075
Speaker1: give me

1857
00:30:58,135 --> 00:30:58,917
Speaker1: facts.

1858
00:30:58,897 --> 00:30:59,539
Speaker1: I

1859
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,401
Speaker1: came on here

1860
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,283
Speaker1: because I

1861
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:02,085
Speaker1: was preparing to

1862
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:03,007
Speaker1: call the employee to

1863
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:03,870
Speaker1: say, yeah,

1864
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,772
Speaker1: here, these are the

1865
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:05,574
Speaker1: reasons why we

1866
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,095
Speaker1: said you were

1867
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,038
Speaker1: violent and could

1868
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:07,619
Speaker1: not be in the

1869
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,441
Speaker1: workplace. Because

1870
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:09,023
Speaker1: that's what that

1871
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:09,745
Speaker1: notice in

1872
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:10,527
Speaker1: essence said to

1873
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:10,767
Speaker1: him.

1874
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:12,251
Speaker1: When you got that

1875
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:12,833
Speaker1: email on

1876
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:13,534
Speaker1: Friday

1877
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:13,935
Speaker1: that

1878
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,249
Speaker1: At

1879
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,070
Speaker1: that, if

1880
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,932
Speaker1: that was not the

1881
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,873
Speaker1: case, you

1882
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:18,814
Speaker1: absolutely could have

1883
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:19,615
Speaker1: followed him and said, hey,

1884
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:20,416
Speaker1: hold on, Diana.

1885
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,197
Speaker1: I wasn't

1886
00:31:21,277 --> 00:31:21,798
Speaker1: invoking

1887
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,319
Speaker1: a

1888
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:22,819
Speaker1: workplace

1889
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:23,420
Speaker1: violence

1890
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,281
Speaker1: act against

1891
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,082
Speaker1: the employee.

1892
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:26,124
Speaker1: This is what was

1893
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,025
Speaker1: really going on.

1894
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:27,966
Speaker1: You didn't do

1895
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:28,327
Speaker1: that.

1896
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:29,648
Speaker1: And to now

1897
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:30,549
Speaker1: imply

1898
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,270
Speaker1: that there is

1899
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:32,272
Speaker1: somehow something

1900
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,073
Speaker1: wrong with

1901
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:33,413
Speaker1: people

1902
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:34,114
Speaker1: experiencing

1903
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:35,836
Speaker1: this process,

1904
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:36,978
Speaker1: because we didn't call

1905
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:37,839
Speaker1: you back and ask you

1906
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,440
Speaker1: if you were really

1907
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,301
Speaker1: sure that

1908
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:40,122
Speaker1: you meant you were

1909
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:40,883
Speaker1: scared enough to

1910
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:41,644
Speaker1: call the police.

1911
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,256
Speaker2: So again,

1912
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:44,796
Speaker1: that's,

1913
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:45,678
Speaker1: that's, that's

1914
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:46,258
Speaker1: not,

1915
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,341
Speaker2: so, so

1916
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:49,322
Speaker2: again, I just want

1917
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:49,803
Speaker2: to make

1918
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:50,504
Speaker1: sure this is

1919
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:51,665
Speaker2: really big though.

1920
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:52,967
Speaker2: You're saying

1921
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:53,808
Speaker2: that, that I didn't think

1922
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:54,609
Speaker2: it was enough

1923
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,411
Speaker2: that you hadn't

1924
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:57,312
Speaker2: removed. So you said that

1925
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:58,073
Speaker2: I may up

1926
00:31:58,313 --> 00:31:59,014
Speaker2: the threat.

1927
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:00,836
Speaker1: Well, what I'm saying

1928
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:01,097
Speaker1: is

1929
00:32:01,157 --> 00:32:02,018
Speaker2: what you said to her

1930
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:02,919
Speaker1: on Friday is not

1931
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:03,800
Speaker1: what you're saying to

1932
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,641
Speaker1: me on Monday.

1933
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:05,702
Speaker1: And you're right. I

1934
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:06,443
Speaker1: don't know why

1935
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:07,144
Speaker1: that is,

1936
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:07,845
Speaker1: but it

1937
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:08,886
Speaker1: concerning that

1938
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:09,086
Speaker1: that's

1939
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:09,647
Speaker1: huge

1940
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:10,889
Speaker1: inconsistency

1941
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:13,011
Speaker1: and it is

1942
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:13,572
Speaker1: glaring.

1943
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:14,093
Speaker1: And

1944
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:15,795
Speaker1: especially

1945
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:16,676
Speaker1: glaring in light of the

1946
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:17,537
Speaker1: fact that you are

1947
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:18,118
Speaker1: attempting to

1948
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:18,939
Speaker1: deflect it back

1949
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:19,580
Speaker1: and say that

1950
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,300
Speaker1: somehow people

1951
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:21,081
Speaker1: experience should have

1952
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:21,562
Speaker1: asked you

1953
00:32:21,602 --> 00:32:22,463
Speaker1: if is

1954
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:23,364
Speaker1: really meant is

1955
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:24,065
Speaker1: and if scared

1956
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:24,606
Speaker1: really meant

1957
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:25,106
Speaker1: scared.

1958
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:26,948
Speaker2: No, I was

1959
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:27,329
Speaker2: saying that if

1960
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:28,310
Speaker2: you think it's a

1961
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,251
Speaker2: concern that the,

1962
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:29,932
Speaker2: you know, issuing a

1963
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:30,753
Speaker2: California SB

1964
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:31,534
Speaker2: 553 if it's

1965
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,275
Speaker2: that serious

1966
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:33,056
Speaker2: before you send it out.

1967
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,138
Speaker2: That's what I'm saying like.

1968
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:36,603
Speaker1: Yeah,

1969
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:37,925
Speaker2: this conversation would

1970
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:38,606
Speaker2: happen way

1971
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:39,427
Speaker2: before that was sent out

1972
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:40,288
Speaker2: then. Because

1973
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:40,749
Speaker2: you know more of the

1974
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:41,590
Speaker2: seriousness of that

1975
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,472
Speaker2: than I do as far as

1976
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:43,573
Speaker2: HR

1977
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:44,795
Speaker2: laws. I don't

1978
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:45,035
Speaker2: know,

1979
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:47,038
Speaker2: sending that out to an

1980
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:47,859
Speaker2: employee, what does

1981
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:48,280
Speaker2: that mean

1982
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,221
Speaker2: legally? That's

1983
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:49,882
Speaker2: not my

1984
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:50,883
Speaker2: expertise. I don't know

1985
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:51,584
Speaker2: anything about that.

1986
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:56,311
Speaker2: there's

1987
00:32:56,371 --> 00:32:56,872
Speaker2: consequences

1988
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:57,753
Speaker2: obviously, there's

1989
00:32:57,813 --> 00:32:58,534
Speaker2: liability issues

1990
00:32:58,594 --> 00:32:59,335
Speaker2: now if you're sending a

1991
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:00,197
Speaker2: rep home without paying on the

1992
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:01,078
Speaker2: state of California, which

1993
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:01,819
Speaker2: I understand the living

1994
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:02,560
Speaker2: California.

1995
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:05,639
Speaker2: But to me,

1996
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:06,099
Speaker2: it's just very

1997
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:06,960
Speaker2: concerning that

1998
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,801
Speaker2: you're telling

1999
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:08,661
Speaker2: me that I made it

2000
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:09,002
Speaker2: up,

2001
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:11,123
Speaker2: that

2002
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:12,765
Speaker2: Diana was not

2003
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:13,545
Speaker2: gonna send him home

2004
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,426
Speaker2: because that wasn't enough.

2005
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:15,047
Speaker2: So then I made

2006
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:15,407
Speaker2: up,

2007
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:17,489
Speaker2: but the whole like he

2008
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:17,829
Speaker2: threatened

2009
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,390
Speaker2: me so

2010
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,271
Speaker2: that way he can go,

2011
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:20,331
Speaker2: he

2012
00:33:20,952 --> 00:33:21,712
Speaker2: can get pushed out of the

2013
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:22,613
Speaker2: store. Like to me, that's

2014
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:22,833
Speaker2: just-

2015
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:24,014
Speaker1: I'm gonna put it to

2016
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:24,655
Speaker1: you this way.

2017
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:25,475
Speaker1: Can I

2018
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:26,176
Speaker1: prove that

2019
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:26,977
Speaker1: that's why you

2020
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:27,337
Speaker1: did it?

2021
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:27,998
Speaker1: No.

2022
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:29,459
Speaker1: What I can

2023
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,280
Speaker1: say though,

2024
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,320

00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:33,002
Speaker1: very,

2027
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:33,682
Speaker1: very

2028
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,403
Speaker1: disappointed

2029
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:36,024
Speaker1: it with

2030
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:36,665
Speaker1: this series of

2031
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:37,566
Speaker1: events and the way

2032
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:38,367
Speaker1: this transpire.

2033
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:42,453
Speaker2: Well, I'm just want

2034
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:43,375
Speaker2: to help hold this.

2035
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,076
Speaker2: Yeah. How this

2036
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:44,837
Speaker2: has all turned

2037
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:45,137
Speaker2: out.

2038
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:46,018
Speaker1: And I'm really

2039
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:46,739
Speaker1: disappointed

2040
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:47,240
Speaker1: that

2041
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:48,882
Speaker1: although you,

2042
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:50,244
Speaker1: you know what?

2043
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:51,987
Speaker2: Yeah, I

2044
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:52,888
Speaker2: think we need a

2045
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:53,709
Speaker2: conversation. I

2046
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,591
Speaker2: need to talk to my

2047

Speaker1: will.

2303
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:16,087
Speaker2: Because

2304
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:16,928
Speaker2: I can

2305
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:17,829
Speaker2: tell you right now, there's no way

2306
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:18,730

Speaker2: tell you that right now.

2312
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:23,955
Speaker2: There's no way. Then if he

00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:24,796
Speaker1: acts up in the

2314
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:25,617
Speaker1: store and he's

2315
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:26,578
Speaker1: unprofessional,

2316
00:38:26,658 --> 00:38:27,379
Speaker1: then you can

2317
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:28,420
Speaker1: absolutely

2318
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:29,581
Speaker1: deal with it

2319
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:30,542
Speaker1: then. But

2320
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:30,743
Speaker1: you

2321
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:31,664
Speaker1: absolutely

2322
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:32,304
Speaker1: can't tell

2323
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:33,145
Speaker1: somebody they can't

2324
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:33,906
Speaker1: come to work just

2325
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:34,647
Speaker1: because they tell you

2326
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:35,548
Speaker1: they're gonna sue you for

2327
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:36,769
Speaker1: discrimination.

2328
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:38,033
Speaker1: Not going to

2329
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:38,514
Speaker1: happen.

2330
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:39,917
Speaker2: And I didn't tell him

2331
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:40,578
Speaker2: because of that. And

2332
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:42,703
Speaker1: I'm telling you,

2333
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:43,304
Speaker1: we can't

2334
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:43,685
Speaker1: either.

2335
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:46,471
Speaker2: The reason I contact

2336
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,373
Speaker2: Diana was because

2337
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:48,174
Speaker2: how he was

2338
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:49,056
Speaker2: blasting the

2339
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:49,758
Speaker2: team.

2340
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,742
Speaker2: Correct. The

2341
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:52,704
Speaker2: reason why I call

2342
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:53,606
Speaker2: and how do we handle

2343
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:54,167
Speaker2: this?

2344
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:55,600
Speaker1: And she's

2345
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,321
Speaker1: going to do

2346
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,382
Speaker1: exactly what

2347
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:58,363
Speaker1: she told you. And what

2348
00:38:58,443 --> 00:38:59,224
Speaker1: I just told you

2351
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:01,627
Speaker1: investigate.

2352
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:02,629
Speaker1: And if

2353
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:03,310
Speaker1: warranted

2354
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,371
Speaker1: corrective action

2355
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:04,811
Speaker1: will be

2356
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:05,492
Speaker1: recommended

2357
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:06,594
Speaker1: based on the

2358
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:07,335
Speaker1: behavior he's

2359
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:07,995
Speaker1: actually

2360
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:08,556
Speaker1: exhibiting,

2361
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:09,337
Speaker1: which is the

00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:09,958
Speaker1: blasting the

2363
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:10,779
Speaker1: messages. And in

2364
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:11,660
Speaker1: fact, we'll attempt to

2365
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,581
Speaker1: clarify with him,

2366
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:13,742
Speaker1: Hey, we've looked

2367
00:39:13,803 --> 00:39:14,503
Speaker1: at the cost from your

2368
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:15,344
Speaker1: recruiter. Here's what

2369
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:16,206
Speaker1: your recruiter told

2370
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:16,406
Speaker1: you.

2371
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:18,088
Speaker2: And if,

2372
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:19,109
Speaker2: if, if, if T

2373
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:19,630
Speaker2: rock makes the

2374
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,170
Speaker2: decision,

2375
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,132

Speaker2: Gerardo.

2379
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:27,664
Speaker2: don't conclude

2380
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:28,385
Speaker2: that it was a threat,

2381
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:29,466
Speaker2: then that's fine.

2382
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:30,246
Speaker2: I'm okay with

2383
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:30,947
Speaker2: that, because that

00:39:37,953 --> 00:39:38,334
Speaker2: team

2394
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:38,934

Speaker2: I'm fine with that. Now,

2403
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:46,962

Speaker2: And he told me that too. And

2414
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:56,181
Speaker2: I said,

2415
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:57,603
Speaker2: Natasha,

2416
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:58,724
Speaker2: I understand, I

2417
00:39:58,784 --> 00:39:59,125
Speaker2: get it.

2418
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:00,346
Speaker2: He said, his mom is

2419
00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:01,548
Speaker2: sick.

2420
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:01,828
Speaker2: I said,

2421
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:03,470
Speaker2: my mom is sick too.

2422
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:04,651
Speaker2: She's 85, I

2423
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:05,312
Speaker2: get it. But I

2424
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:07,755
Speaker2: can't fix that.

2425
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:08,215
Speaker2: Our

2426
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:09,397
Speaker2: focus is the

2427
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:10,298
Speaker2: program. This is a

2428
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:11,059
Speaker2: short six-week

2429
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:11,960
Speaker2: program. We're trying

2430
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,240
Speaker2: to

2431
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:13,602
Speaker2: get more work from

2432
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:14,543
Speaker2: Bose. I've been

2433
00:40:14,563 --> 00:40:15,204
Speaker2: working on the Bose

2434
00:40:15,224 --> 00:40:15,924
Speaker2: program for three

2435
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:16,365
Speaker2: years. So

2436
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:17,446
Speaker2: I

2437
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:18,347
Speaker2: said, that's the focus.

2438
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:18,968
Speaker2: I wanted him to get,

2439
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,370
Speaker2: that's the focus. And

2440
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,111
Speaker2: then it just did

2441
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,072
Speaker2: not even work at all.

2442
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:22,732
Speaker2: And I

2443
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:23,633
Speaker2: said, okay, well, I

2444
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,094
Speaker2: tried.

2445
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:25,295
Speaker2: calm them down,

2446
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:25,917
Speaker2: you know?

2447
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:26,758
Speaker2: And

2448
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:27,039
Speaker2: then the

2449
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,341
Speaker2: barrage of taxes

2450
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:29,584
Speaker2: started happening. Then

2451
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:30,485
Speaker2: Chris, my partner

2452
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:31,307
Speaker2: account, he's like, what do we

2453
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:32,209
Speaker2: do? I said, well, I called

2454
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:32,810
Speaker2: Eric, he's not

2455
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,792
Speaker2: answering. So

2456
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:34,634
Speaker2: Eric did say, well, call

2457
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:35,515
Speaker2: Dan, okay, Diana,

2458
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:36,297
Speaker2: here's the issue,

2459
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,221
Speaker2: you know? And I

2460
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:39,102
Speaker2: had just got off the phone

2461
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:39,403
Speaker2: with him

2462
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:40,204
Speaker2: and I

2463
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,006
Speaker2: shared with Diana how

2464
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:41,607
Speaker2: I was

2465
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:42,289
Speaker2: feeling at

2466
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:43,431
Speaker2: the moment.

2467
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:45,715
Speaker2: Because that's what I

2468
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:46,116
Speaker2: felt.

2469
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:49,952
Speaker2: So if you

2470
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:50,653
Speaker2: concluded,

2471
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:51,955
Speaker2: and

2472
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:52,776
Speaker2: I respected, like,

2473
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:53,657
Speaker2: you know what, I don't think

2474
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,358
Speaker2: it was threatening, then

2475
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:55,019
Speaker2: okay, fine,

2476
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:55,840
Speaker2: I'm okay

2477
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,621
Speaker2: with that. That's

2478
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:57,463
Speaker2: not my concern. My making

2479
00:40:57,483 --> 00:40:58,304
Speaker2: concern, is he gonna go back

2480
00:40:58,344 --> 00:40:58,765
Speaker2: to the store?

2481
00:40:59,165 --> 00:40:59,946
Speaker2: On a personal level,

2482
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:01,308
Speaker2: yes. On a

2483
00:41:01,348 --> 00:41:01,849
Speaker2: personal level, of

2484
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:02,790
Speaker2: course. You

2485
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,572
Speaker2: know, I've got my family

2486
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:04,072
Speaker2: here. I have this

2487
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:05,334
Speaker2: person who's just

2488
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:06,296
Speaker2: very frustrated,

2489
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:07,898
Speaker2: mad, anger,

2490
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:08,579
Speaker2: you know,

2491
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,400
Speaker2: mad at the world,

2492
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,001
Speaker2: mad at me.

2493
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:10,962
Speaker2: Yeah, of course,

2494
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:12,565
Speaker2: I'm gonna feel the way.

2495
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:13,426
Speaker2: I'm human, and

2496
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:14,187
Speaker2: that's what I felt

2497
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:14,447
Speaker2: on

2498
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:15,529
Speaker2: Friday.

2499
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:16,525
Speaker2: for the safety of me and my

2500
00:41:16,585 --> 00:41:17,266
Speaker2: family. Of course,

2501
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:17,887
Speaker2: everything runs

2502
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:18,868
Speaker2: through your head in

2503
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:19,489
Speaker2: today's

2504
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,810
Speaker2: society. But if

2505
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:22,252
Speaker2: T-ROC says, no, we

2506
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,013
Speaker2: don't feel like there's any

2507
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:23,814
Speaker2: threat, then that's fine.

2508
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:24,034
Speaker2: I'm

2509
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,356
Speaker2: okay

2510
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:25,476
Speaker2: with

2511
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:26,778
Speaker2: that.

2512
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,699
Speaker2: That's

2513
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:28,520
Speaker2: your investigation. You

2514
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,321
Speaker2: know how to do this. This is

2515
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:30,182
Speaker2: your job. But

2516
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:31,844
Speaker2: I just wanna

2517
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,324
Speaker2: be clear,

2518
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:34,067
Speaker2: Latasha, I would

2519
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:34,908
Speaker2: never, in

2520
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:35,869
Speaker2: my career

2521
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:36,910
Speaker2: ever,

2522
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,243
Speaker2: come up with something

2523
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:39,104
Speaker2: and say, well, if

2524
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,085
Speaker2: his

2525
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,007
Speaker2: discrimination is not

2526
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:41,868
Speaker2: enough or

2527
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,729
Speaker2: his comments are not enough

2528
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:43,490
Speaker2: to get

2529
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,372
Speaker2: removed

2530
00:41:45,392 --> 00:41:46,213
Speaker2: from the program, well, let

2531
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:46,934
Speaker2: me throw in that I

2532
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:47,675
Speaker2: felt violent.

2533
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:49,077
Speaker2: I felt violence

2534
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:50,058
Speaker2: towards me. Maybe

2535
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:50,899
Speaker2: without getting removed

2536
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:51,420
Speaker2: from the store.

2537
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,381
Speaker2: No, I

2538
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:53,943
Speaker2: would never do

2539
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:54,263
Speaker2: that.

2540
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:55,965
Speaker2: And if that's how you

2541
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:56,866
Speaker2: feel, then that's how

2542
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:57,607
Speaker2: you feel. But that's

2543
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:58,128
Speaker2: just, I would

2544
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,109
Speaker2: never do that.

2545
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,532
Speaker2: Never, never do

2546
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:02,373
Speaker2: that. And

2547
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:03,174
Speaker2: that's concerning

2548
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:03,595
Speaker2: to me,

2549
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:04,656
Speaker2: but

2550
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,238
Speaker2: it is what it is.

2551
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:07,228
Speaker1: Well, it,

2552
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,109
Speaker1: like I said, it's

2553
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,029
Speaker1: concerning because

2554
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,990
Speaker1: it feels like the,

2555
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:10,871
Speaker1: the threatening

2556
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:11,732
Speaker1: part of it

2557
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:12,533
Speaker1: was made up.

2558
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:13,694
Speaker1: That's all I'm

2559
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:14,034
Speaker1: saying.

2560
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:15,195
Speaker2: Oh, now it's made

2561
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,016
Speaker2: up. Oh, now

2562
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:17,578
Speaker2: so made up now.

2563
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:18,659
Speaker1: I don't know why,

2564
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:19,239
Speaker1: but I

2565
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:19,840
Speaker1: can't,

2566
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,021
Speaker1: it's not based

2567
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:21,461
Speaker1: on any

2568
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,142
Speaker1: objective

2569
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:23,123
Speaker1: facts that you

2570
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:23,964
Speaker1: were able to convey

2571
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:24,624
Speaker1: to us. How's

2572
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:24,924
Speaker1: that?

2573
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:25,705
Speaker2: So it's

2574
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:26,386
Speaker2: objective

2575
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:26,886
Speaker2: facts.

2576
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:30,189
Speaker2: Okay. Not always

2577
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:30,590
Speaker2: feeling

2578
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,211
Speaker2: cause you didn't, you weren't there

2579
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:32,952
Speaker2: with me, but

2580
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:37,928
Speaker1: Well, if we

2581
00:42:38,028 --> 00:42:38,649
Speaker1: feel a way,

2582
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:39,751
Speaker1: right? The

2583
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:40,692
Speaker1: feelings are

2584
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:41,493
Speaker1: based on something

2585
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:42,334
Speaker1: factually that

2586
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,236
Speaker1: happened. And so

2587
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:43,997
Speaker1: I've asked you

2588
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:45,779
Speaker1: what factually

2589
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:46,580
Speaker1: happened

2590
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,501
Speaker2: that led you to feel

2591
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:48,022
Speaker2: that way.

2592
00:42:49,364 --> 00:42:50,245
Speaker2: So feelings have to be

2593
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:50,686
Speaker2: fact.

2594
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:51,968
Speaker2: It's not how I'm feeling

2595
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:52,529
Speaker2: personally.

2596
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:52,989
Speaker1: No,

2597
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,171
Speaker1: how you feel

2598
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:54,992
Speaker1: personally is

2599
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:56,995
Speaker1: based on a

2600
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:57,816
Speaker1: series of facts

2601
00:42:57,856 --> 00:42:58,617
Speaker1: that occur. And I

2602
00:42:58,717 --> 00:42:59,098
Speaker1: asked you

2603
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:00,039
Speaker1: share

2604
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,481
Speaker1: the facts that

2605
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:02,002
Speaker1: happened

2606
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:03,023
Speaker1: that made you

2607
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:03,324
Speaker1: feel

2608
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:04,305
Speaker1: unsafe.

2609
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:06,713
Speaker1: What happened to

2610
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:07,614
Speaker1: you that caused

2611
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:08,115
Speaker1: you to

2612
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,096
Speaker1: feel the way you

2613
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:09,397
Speaker1: felt?

2614
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,581
Speaker2: And that's what I felt.

2615
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:13,502
Speaker2: And now I have T-Rock

2616
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,203
Speaker2: coming back to me

2617
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:14,844
Speaker2: saying, nope,

2618
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:16,967
Speaker2: you shouldn't have felt that

2619
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:17,187
Speaker2: way.

2620
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:18,689
Speaker1: No, I'm telling

2621
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:19,590
Speaker1: you, because you

2622
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,271
Speaker1: told me you

2623
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:21,653
Speaker1: could not come up

2624
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:22,554
Speaker1: with a reason.

2625
00:43:23,175 --> 00:43:23,815
Speaker1: But you know

2626
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:24,637
Speaker1: what?

2627
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:25,337
Speaker1: It's fine.

2628
00:43:25,818 --> 00:43:26,739
Speaker1: It's

2629
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:27,380
Speaker2: fine.

2630
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:28,562
Speaker2: So that's

2631
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:29,343
Speaker2: what I felt.

2632
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:32,387
Speaker2: And now T-Rock

2633
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:33,007
Speaker2: saying, well,

2634
00:43:33,128 --> 00:43:33,328
Speaker2: nope,

2635
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:34,950
Speaker2: you

2636
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,211
Speaker2: how you felt was in

2637
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,193
Speaker2: facts, and now

2638
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,034
Speaker2: that's concerning.

2639
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,256
Speaker2: And

2640
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:39,876
Speaker2: you're concerned,

2641
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:40,958
Speaker2: because I'm not a

2642
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:41,859
Speaker2: senior executive, I

2643
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker2: wish I was,

2644
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:43,582
Speaker2: senior manager

2645
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:44,583
Speaker2: or senior executive.

2646
00:43:45,184 --> 00:43:45,745
Speaker2: said senior

2647
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:46,386
Speaker1: manager. I

2648
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:47,087
Speaker2: gotta be more

2649
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:47,688
Speaker2: careful with my

2650
00:43:47,768 --> 00:43:48,209
Speaker2: words on

2651
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:49,370
Speaker2: how it's feeling, but

2652
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,131
Speaker2: you're saying, nope, I

2653
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:50,993
Speaker2: don't think it was feeling,

2654
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:51,714
Speaker2: so I think you made it

2655
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:51,934
Speaker2: up.

2656
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:53,937
Speaker2: And so now

2657
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:54,718
Speaker2: you're saying like, this

2658
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:55,279
Speaker2: looks bad.

2659
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,461
Speaker2: Like, I just, I'm

2660
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:56,701
Speaker2: just,

2661
00:43:57,182 --> 00:43:57,462
Speaker2: I'm...

2662
00:43:58,471 --> 00:43:59,252
Speaker1: No, and what I'm

2663
00:43:59,312 --> 00:43:59,673
Speaker1: saying is

2664
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:00,874
Speaker1: when I come

2665
00:44:01,115 --> 00:44:01,655
Speaker1: and say,

2666
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:02,597
Speaker1: okay, tell me

2667
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:03,438
Speaker1: what he said

2668
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:04,319
Speaker1: and what he did

2669
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:04,760
Speaker1: that was

2670
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,421
Speaker1: threatening.

2671
00:44:06,682 --> 00:44:07,644
Speaker1: And

2672
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:09,566
Speaker1: maybe

2673
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:10,127
Speaker1: my

2674
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,228
Speaker1: expectation

2675
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:11,990
Speaker1: of what

2676
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:12,951
Speaker1: you would

2677
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:13,632
Speaker1: convey

2678
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:14,633
Speaker1: as

2679
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:14,954
Speaker1: being

2680
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:16,556
Speaker1: threatening

2681
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:17,016
Speaker1: to you,

2682
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:20,621
Speaker1: like I would

2683
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:21,583
Speaker1: never, okay, I'm gonna

2684
00:44:21,603 --> 00:44:22,023
Speaker1: put it this way,

2685
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:23,325
Speaker1: reporting that

2686
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:23,966
Speaker1: someone

2687
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:25,067
Speaker1: that you work

2688
00:44:25,148 --> 00:44:25,508
Speaker1: with

2689
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:26,931
Speaker1: Threatening you

2690
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:27,532
Speaker1: is a

2691
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:28,474
Speaker1: very serious

2692
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:29,356
Speaker1: allegation.

2693
00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:29,977
Speaker1: And

2694
00:44:30,158 --> 00:44:30,819
Speaker2: I would never

2695
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,581
Speaker1: make that

2696
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:32,323
Speaker1: without

2697
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:33,625
Speaker1: being able to

2698
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:33,986
Speaker1: say,

2699
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,109
Speaker1: Hey,

2700
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:37,073
Speaker1: he told me

2701
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:37,875
Speaker1: if I don't

2702
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:38,636
Speaker1: have his money,

2703
00:44:39,017 --> 00:44:39,839
Speaker1: he's going to bust me

2704
00:44:39,899 --> 00:44:40,621
Speaker1: upside my head.

2705
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,623
Speaker1: Or he said, I'm

2706
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:42,305
Speaker1: getting in my car

2707
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:42,826
Speaker1: right now

2708
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:44,449
Speaker1: and I'm heading up

2709
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:44,830
Speaker1: there.

2710
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:46,347
Speaker1: and you will

2711
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:47,028
Speaker1: do,

2712
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:48,089
Speaker1: like, that's the

2713
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:48,951
Speaker1: kind of thing

2714
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:49,772
Speaker1: that I

2715
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:50,673
Speaker1: was looking for

2716
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:51,594
Speaker1: when you report

2717
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:52,395
Speaker1: to HR

2718
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:53,196
Speaker1: that somebody's

2719
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:54,538
Speaker1: threatening you and

2720
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:55,479
Speaker1: you're afraid of them

2721
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:56,380
Speaker1: and you need to call the

2722
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:56,881
Speaker1: police.

2723
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:00,226
Speaker2: Yeah, that's how I was

2724
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:00,886
Speaker2: feeling though.

2725
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:03,710
Speaker2: I didn't call the

2726
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,611
Speaker2: police. I

2727
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:05,312
Speaker2: told Dana,

2728
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:06,354
Speaker2: I feel like I should have called

2729
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:07,195
Speaker2: the police. I didn't say I

2730
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:08,056
Speaker2: wanted to call the police.

2731
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:08,777
Speaker2: I never did call the

2732
00:45:08,797 --> 00:45:09,578
Speaker2: police. But

2733
00:45:09,598 --> 00:45:10,419
Speaker2: yeah, that's how I

2734
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,020
Speaker2: was feeling.

2735
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:12,226
Speaker2: Here's an

2736
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:13,147
Speaker2: individual, and if

2737
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:14,049
Speaker2: you spoke to him, and

2738
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:15,291
Speaker2: I'm sure you've talked to him,

2739
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:15,952
Speaker2: or Dan, and

2740
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:17,174
Speaker2: you've probably talked to him,

2741
00:45:17,354 --> 00:45:17,654
Speaker2: yeah.

2742
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:20,158
Speaker2: Listening to

2743
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:20,358
Speaker2: him,

2744
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:21,661
Speaker2: yeah, that's how I

2745
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:21,921
Speaker2: felt.

2746
00:45:22,522 --> 00:45:23,103
Speaker2: And if you've

2747
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:23,644
Speaker2: concluded,

2748
00:45:23,864 --> 00:45:24,445
Speaker2: like, you know

2749
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:25,226

Speaker2: Latasha, for

00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,191
Speaker2: legality, like,

2754
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:28,872
Speaker2: you have to make the

2755
00:45:28,912 --> 00:45:29,673
Speaker2: decision because,

2756
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:30,454
Speaker2: like, if you had to go

2757
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:31,356
Speaker2: in a court of law,

2758
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:31,616
Speaker2: right,

2759
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:32,898
Speaker2: you have to present,

2760
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:33,479
Speaker2: like, here's

2761
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:34,040
Speaker2: Gerardo,

2762
00:45:34,461 --> 00:45:35,222
Speaker2: this is how he's felt,

2763
00:45:35,262 --> 00:45:36,103
Speaker2: right? And if you feel like, you

2764
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:36,604
Speaker2: know what, there's

2765
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:37,565
Speaker2: nothing that you're

2766
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:38,106
Speaker2: saying to me

2767
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:38,627
Speaker2: that

2768
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:40,738
Speaker2: makes it, you

2769
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:41,519
Speaker2: know, in the court of

2770
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:42,401
Speaker2: law, whatever those

2771
00:45:42,441 --> 00:45:43,222
Speaker2: laws might be, I

2772
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:43,824
Speaker2: get that.

2773
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:45,427
Speaker2: But I would, I

2774
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:46,449
Speaker2: feel like at least

2775
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:46,789
Speaker2: some

2776
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:47,611
Speaker2: understanding from

2777
00:45:47,651 --> 00:45:48,513
Speaker2: T-ROC, like,

2778
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:49,154
Speaker2: hey, we

2779
00:45:49,174 --> 00:45:49,695
Speaker2: understanding you

2780
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:50,076
Speaker2: feeling,

2781
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:51,639
Speaker2: it doesn't

2782
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:52,580
Speaker2: reach that level we

2783
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,442
Speaker2: think, we can't

2784
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:54,344
Speaker2: prove that in a court of law,

2785
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:55,206
Speaker2: because this is what at the end of

2786
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:55,526
Speaker2: the day,

2787
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:56,388
Speaker2: you know,

2788
00:45:56,408 --> 00:45:57,430
Speaker2: okay,

2789
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:57,951
Speaker2: it's fine. I

2790
00:45:58,231 --> 00:45:59,113
Speaker2: mean,

2791
00:45:59,313 --> 00:46:00,175
Speaker2: It's not like you're gonna

2792
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:00,796
Speaker2: go get

2793
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:01,598
Speaker2: security guards

2794
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:02,079
Speaker2: coming by.

2795
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,001
Speaker2: T-ROD's not gonna do

2796
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:03,923
Speaker2: anything different if

2797
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:04,905
Speaker2: he was,

2798
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:05,707
Speaker2: you

2799
00:46:05,747 --> 00:46:05,927
Speaker2: know, if

2800
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:07,310
Speaker2: he was to feel

2801
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:08,032
Speaker2: threatened. So if

2802
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,154
Speaker2: you feel like, you know what,

2803
00:46:09,175 --> 00:46:09,836
Speaker2: Gerardo, there's really

2804
00:46:09,856 --> 00:46:10,738
Speaker2: nothing legally

2805
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:11,660
Speaker2: wise that we can hold in

2806
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,602
Speaker2: court, fine.

2807
00:46:12,622 --> 00:46:13,584
Speaker2: No

2808
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:14,506
Speaker2: worries, I get

2809
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:15,228
Speaker2: that. It's not like

2810
00:46:15,288 --> 00:46:15,909
Speaker2: this is my first

2811
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:16,731
Speaker2: rodeo.

2812
00:46:17,217 --> 00:46:18,039
Speaker2: But I don't feel there's

2813
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,962
Speaker2: anything wrong with

2814
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:19,664
Speaker2: me sharing how I

2815
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:20,647
Speaker2: felt, but

2816
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:21,269
Speaker2: it's just kind of a

2817
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,091
Speaker2: bummer that

2818
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:22,954
Speaker2: now T-rock is

2819
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:23,796
Speaker2: coming at me saying

2820
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:24,719
Speaker2: that I'm

2821
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:25,541
Speaker2: wrong, they're

2822
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:26,324
Speaker2: disappointed in

2823
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:26,584
Speaker2: me,

2824
00:46:27,186 --> 00:46:27,547
Speaker2: like

2825
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,751
Speaker2: your

2826
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:29,252
Speaker2: feelings weren't

2827
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:29,894
Speaker2: facts,

2828
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:30,636
Speaker2: like...

2829
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:31,712
Speaker1: You're

2830
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:32,493
Speaker1: entitled to

2831
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:33,294
Speaker1: your feelings,

2832
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:34,235
Speaker1: but understand,

2833
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:35,036
Speaker1: Gerardo, that when

2834
00:46:35,076 --> 00:46:35,196
Speaker1: you

2835
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:36,638
Speaker1: report

2836
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:36,718
Speaker1: it

2837
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:37,579
Speaker1: to

2838
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:37,979
Speaker1: us,

2839
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:39,922
Speaker1: you're not telling your

2840
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:40,743
Speaker1: therapist how you

2841
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:41,524
Speaker1: felt. You're telling

2842
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:42,365
Speaker1: us you want us to

2843
00:46:42,405 --> 00:46:43,186
Speaker1: take action against

2844
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:43,506
Speaker1: another

2845
00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:44,347
Speaker1: employee. And

2846
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:45,088
Speaker1: that's a different

2847
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:45,629
Speaker1: standard.

2848
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,570
Speaker2: That's a legal

2849
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:47,692
Speaker2: standard. I didn't

2850
00:46:47,712 --> 00:46:48,533
Speaker2: say to take action

2851
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:49,874
Speaker2: because he was being

2852
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:50,355
Speaker2: violent.

2853
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,801
Speaker2: The reason why I called

2854
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:55,682
Speaker2: Diana was because

2855
00:46:55,742 --> 00:46:56,563
Speaker2: of his texting. I didn't

2856
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:57,043
Speaker2: know how to stop

2857
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:57,484
Speaker2: that.

2858
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:58,971
Speaker2: Eric's like,

2859
00:46:58,991 --> 00:46:59,631
Speaker2: contact

2860
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,332
Speaker2: Lucas, and

2861
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:01,334
Speaker2: Lucas, I can't delete

2862
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:02,115
Speaker2: it. I'm like,

2863
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:02,675
Speaker2: okay, fine.

2864
00:47:04,097 --> 00:47:04,898
Speaker2: That is the reason why I

2865
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:05,699
Speaker2: originally called

2866
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,500
Speaker2: Diana, was

2867
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,421

00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,242
Speaker2: rep who's just going

2869
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:09,264
Speaker2: off the rails here,

2870
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:09,464
Speaker2: he's

2871
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:10,926
Speaker2: already sending,

2872
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:12,047
Speaker2: and talk to

00:47:13,549 --> 00:47:14,110
Speaker2: Mikkel,

2874
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:16,553
Speaker2: who also manages him,

2875
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:17,354
Speaker2: he had the same

2876
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:18,235
Speaker2: experience with him.

2877
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:21,719
Speaker2: told him to submit a

2878
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:22,240
Speaker2: report,

2879
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:24,047
Speaker2: but that's

2880
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:24,868
Speaker2: how I felt. But yeah, I

2881
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:25,689
Speaker2: know no in

00:47:25,729 --> 00:47:26,430
Speaker2: time that I said,

2883
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,351
Speaker2: well, I gotta get him

2884
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:28,253
Speaker2: out of here. I'm gonna throw in,

2885
00:47:28,693 --> 00:47:29,574
Speaker2: you know, fear

2886
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:30,315
Speaker2: or like he's being

2887
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,176
Speaker2: threatening to get him out.

2888
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:31,657
Speaker2: Cause that's

2889
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:32,578
Speaker2: the,

2890
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:32,698
Speaker2: Oh,

2891
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,301
Speaker2: but I just shared

2892
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:35,122
Speaker2: it. I

2893
00:47:35,162 --> 00:47:35,642
Speaker2: was feeling

2894
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:36,283
Speaker2: that's all.

2895
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:37,665
Speaker1: I don't think, I

2896
00:47:37,685 --> 00:47:38,346
Speaker1: don't, I think,

2897
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:39,487
Speaker1: I think that

2898
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:41,750
Speaker1: what,

2899
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:42,692
Speaker1: what

2900
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,033
Speaker1: isn't clear here

2901
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:44,955
Speaker1: is I completely

2902
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:45,635
Speaker1: understood

2903
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,376
Speaker1: what

2904
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:47,298
Speaker1: your complaint was

2905
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:48,139
Speaker1: originally.

2906
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,320
Speaker1: Your complaint was

2907
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:51,383
Speaker1: that he,

2908
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:53,068
Speaker1: was doing

2909
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:53,929
Speaker1: a lot in teams and

2910
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:54,510
Speaker1: you wanted to get it

2911
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,051
Speaker1: removed and

2912
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:56,272
Speaker1: you didn't really want him

2913
00:47:56,352 --> 00:47:57,173
Speaker1: working because,

2914
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:57,634
Speaker1: you know,

2915
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,176
Speaker1: he was not,

2916
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,037
Speaker1: you didn't feel like he was

2917
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:00,798
Speaker1: stable. I got

2918
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:01,238
Speaker1: that. I

2919
00:48:01,418 --> 00:48:02,179
Speaker1: completely understood

2920
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:02,960
Speaker1: that. And I

2921
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,861
Speaker1: did say, you know,

2922
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:04,803
Speaker1: Gerardo, go ahead and put an

2923
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,624
Speaker1: investigation, smart

2924
00:48:05,644 --> 00:48:05,884
Speaker1: sheet,

00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,306
Speaker1: put it, include all the

2926
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:08,047
Speaker1: screenshots, include

2927
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:08,527
Speaker1: everything.

2928
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,311
Speaker1: We were fine up until

2929
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,152
Speaker1: that point. But then

2930
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:12,672
Speaker1: when you said

2931
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:14,054
Speaker1: that

2932
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:15,296
Speaker1: saying, I know, you know, I don't

2933
00:48:15,316 --> 00:48:16,177
Speaker1: know at this point, I don't know

2934
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:16,958
Speaker1: what this guy's going to do.

2935
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:17,879
Speaker1: I,

2936
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:18,940
Speaker1: I,

2937
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:22,810
Speaker2: I was sharing with

2938
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,231
Speaker2: you like.

2939
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:24,472
Speaker1: No, and I get

2940
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:25,333
Speaker1: that, but but you

2941
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:25,593
Speaker1: know,

2942
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:27,035
Speaker1: yes,

2943
00:48:27,055 --> 00:48:27,795
Speaker1: but it's not really

2944
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:28,556
Speaker1: just talking when you're

2945
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:29,197
Speaker1: speaking to someone

2946
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:30,578
Speaker1: who's

2947
00:48:30,598 --> 00:48:31,059
Speaker1: in HR.

2948
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:32,180
Speaker1: If I feel like

2949
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,101
Speaker1: you're you're getting

2950
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:34,002
Speaker1: this off your chest, like I

2951
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:34,703
Speaker1: don't think he's stable.

2952
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:35,984
Speaker1: I feel like I

2953
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:36,805
Speaker1: need to call the police. I

2954
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:37,345
Speaker1: don't know what he's

2955
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:38,206
Speaker1: capable of. At that

2956
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:38,567
Speaker1: point,

2957
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:40,068
Speaker1: you're fearing for your

2958
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:40,969
Speaker1: safety, whether

2959
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:41,510
Speaker1: that's what you

2960
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,351
Speaker1: intended to tell

2961
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:43,011
Speaker1: me or not.

2962
00:48:43,952 --> 00:48:44,833
Speaker1: Right. And that's

2963
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:45,754
Speaker1: all that's all it's all

2964
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:46,195
Speaker1: she's saying.

2965
00:48:46,495 --> 00:48:47,196
Speaker1: You saying that

2966
00:48:47,236 --> 00:48:48,057
Speaker1: statement to me is

2967
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:48,457
Speaker1: what made

2968
00:48:48,537 --> 00:48:49,298
Speaker1: me

2969
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,501
Speaker1: react and

2970
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:51,302
Speaker1: go ahead and remove

2971
00:48:51,322 --> 00:48:52,183
Speaker1: him from the schedule. It

2972
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,084
Speaker1: was not about

2973
00:48:53,285 --> 00:48:53,865
Speaker1: the messages.

2974
00:48:55,568 --> 00:48:56,229
Speaker2: why I decided to

2975
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:57,130
Speaker2: tell for your life.

2976
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,031
Speaker2: Like when you know,

2977
00:48:58,071 --> 00:48:58,491
Speaker2: but

2978
00:48:59,052 --> 00:48:59,913
Speaker2: I told you to put it on, I

2979
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:00,674
Speaker1: told you to put it

2980
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:01,475
Speaker1: on. No,

2981
00:49:01,495 --> 00:49:02,356
Speaker2: I told you to put him on.

2982
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:02,537
Speaker2: I'm

2983
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:03,578
Speaker2: like, you're gonna

2984
00:49:03,618 --> 00:49:04,359
Speaker2: investigate his

2985
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,120
Speaker2: chats. I'm like,

2986
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,681
Speaker2: that makes

2987
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:06,582
Speaker2: totally mistakes.

2988
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:06,882
Speaker2: I've been,

2989
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:08,905
Speaker2: that made sense to me. I'm

2990
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:09,446
Speaker2: like, oh,

2991
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:10,727
Speaker2: I'm pulling off the program.

2992
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:11,508
Speaker2: Like, yeah, you guys, you're

2993
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,430
Speaker2: gonna investigate his

2994
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:14,172
Speaker2: unhappiness. Should be

2995
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,073
Speaker2: working at T-ROC. He

2996
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:15,754
Speaker2: doesn't seem happy at

2997
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:16,255
Speaker2: all. Like

2998
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:17,416
Speaker2: to me, that seemed

2999
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:18,137
Speaker2: fair.

3000
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,041
Speaker1: But did you

3001
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:19,542
Speaker1: see how our

3002
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,343
Speaker1: conversation went?

3003
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:21,665
Speaker1: You just agreed with me

3004
00:49:21,745 --> 00:49:22,566
Speaker1: to every point that I

3005
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,427
Speaker1: said, we had

3006
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:24,328
Speaker1: this conversation.

3007
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:25,290
Speaker1: I said this.

3008
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,092
Speaker1: I told you put on the

3009
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:27,994
Speaker1: investigation.

3010
00:49:28,114 --> 00:49:28,995
Speaker1: It wasn't until

3011
00:49:29,055 --> 00:49:30,557
Speaker1: you

3012
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:31,058
Speaker1: told me

3013
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:32,400
Speaker1: that you felt

3014
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,201
Speaker1: that you needed to call the

3015
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:34,062
Speaker1: police that I said, well, then

3016
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:34,883
Speaker1: in that case,

3017
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:35,624
Speaker1: I'm just going to remove

3018
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:36,506
Speaker1: him. I

3019
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:37,327
Speaker1: will call him now.

3020
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:38,008
Speaker1: Remember?

3021
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:40,071
Speaker2: No,

3022
00:49:40,131 --> 00:49:40,872
Speaker2: I didn't get no clear

3023
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:41,613
Speaker2: indication that there

3024
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:42,414
Speaker2: isn't a way you're going to

3025
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:43,255
Speaker2: remove him from the store

3026
00:49:43,295 --> 00:49:43,856
Speaker2: because

3027
00:49:43,996 --> 00:49:44,797
Speaker1: I told you that I was

3028
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:45,518
Speaker2: going to call him

3029
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:46,179
Speaker1: and speak to

3030
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:46,740
Speaker1: him.

3031
00:49:47,513 --> 00:49:48,194
Speaker1: The email

3032
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:49,035
Speaker1: that I

3033
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:49,436
Speaker1: sent out

3034
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:51,478
Speaker1: was after I spoke

3035
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:52,299
Speaker1: to him. I did tell you

3036
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,060
Speaker1: that. You told me you

3037
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,942
Speaker1: didn't want to speak to

3038
00:49:53,982 --> 00:49:54,663
Speaker1: him. And I said,

3039
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:55,804
Speaker1: no worries. I will

3040
00:49:55,864 --> 00:49:56,665
Speaker1: call him and let him

3041
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:57,146
Speaker1: know he's been

3042
00:49:57,186 --> 00:49:58,368
Speaker1: removed.

3043
00:49:58,388 --> 00:49:59,069
Speaker1: You don't remember that.

3044
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:01,532
Speaker2: Yeah, I remember.

3045
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:02,593
Speaker2: I'm not going to speak to

3046
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:03,454
Speaker2: him because I couldn't speak

3047
00:50:03,474 --> 00:50:03,935
Speaker2: to him anymore.

3048
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:05,597
Speaker2: He hung up on me.

3049
00:50:05,978 --> 00:50:06,679
Speaker2: He was done. He was

3050
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:07,480

00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:08,802

Speaker2: which is fine. My

3059
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:21,774
Speaker2: concern now is,

00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:24,779
Speaker2: felt.

00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,542
Speaker2: And I have T-Roc coming

3064
00:50:26,602 --> 00:50:27,484

00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:28,345
Speaker2: nope, you didn't feel that

3066
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:28,586
Speaker2: way.

3067
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:30,289
Speaker1: I didn't say you didn't

3068
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:31,130
Speaker1: feel that way, but

3069
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:31,851
Speaker1: I did say

00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:32,613
Speaker1: that how

3071
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:33,474

Speaker2: I am saying- That's what you said, I

3074
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:35,778
Speaker2: wrote it down here.

00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:36,840
Speaker2: That's

3076
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,922
Speaker2: you.

3077
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:38,761
Speaker1: What I'm saying

00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:39,842
Speaker1: you

3080
00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:41,944
Speaker1: didn't give us any

3081
00:50:42,144 --> 00:50:42,725
Speaker1: facts

3082
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:43,886
Speaker1: that we could

3083
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:44,587
Speaker1: use to

3084
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,288
Speaker1: justify

3085
00:50:45,328 --> 00:50:46,008
Speaker1: why we sent

3086
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,789
Speaker1: this guy home

3087
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:47,610
Speaker1: without pay.

3088
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:49,632
Speaker1: What this guy

3089
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:50,433
Speaker1: did, that made

3090
00:50:50,493 --> 00:50:51,374
Speaker1: you feel that way.

3091
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:52,696
Speaker1: You were unable to

3092
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:53,396
Speaker1: articulate

3093
00:50:53,456 --> 00:50:55,178
Speaker1: that.

3094
00:50:55,198 --> 00:50:56,079
Speaker2: Yeah, if that's how you feel during

3095
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:56,860
Speaker2: your investigation,

3096
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,781
Speaker2: great. I don't have a

3097
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:58,382
Speaker2: problem with that.

3098
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:00,063
Speaker2: If you say like, I

3099
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:00,884
Speaker2: interviewed Gerardo just

3100
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:01,825
Speaker2: now and I feel like, you know what,

3101
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:02,706
Speaker2: Gerardo, after you explained to

3102
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:02,826
Speaker2: me

3103
00:51:02,866 --> 00:51:04,068
Speaker2: everything

3104
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:04,928
Speaker2: that you told me about it,

3105
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:05,709
Speaker2: yeah, I don't see

3106
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:06,390
Speaker2: it.

3107
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,501
Speaker2: It can't hold

3108
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:08,442
Speaker2: itself in court

3109
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:09,062
Speaker2: of law. I

3110
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:09,923
Speaker2: totally get that.

3111
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:11,644
Speaker2: Even if you say, well,

3112
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:13,046
Speaker2: even I'm bummed out, like

3113
00:51:13,086 --> 00:51:13,866
Speaker2: that's how I feel. And you're

3114
00:51:13,886 --> 00:51:14,587
Speaker2: like, that's not just

3115
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:15,468
Speaker2: enough, which is fine.

3116
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:16,328
Speaker2: That's okay. You're

3117
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:16,609
Speaker2: doing your

3118
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:17,469
Speaker2: investigation here.

3119
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:18,630
Speaker2: That's what I'm saying,

3120
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:19,791
Speaker2: Latasha. Like

3121
00:51:19,972 --> 00:51:20,832
Speaker2: then I guess this should have

3122
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:21,293
Speaker2: happened

3123
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:21,873

Speaker2: felt, right?

3137
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:34,784
Speaker2: So I'm okay with

3138
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:35,645
Speaker2: that. But my concern

3139
00:51:35,705 --> 00:51:36,546
Speaker2: is now,

3140
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:37,531
Speaker2: coming back to me and

3141
00:51:37,571 --> 00:51:37,751
Speaker2: nope,

3142
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:39,633
Speaker2: you weren't feeling threat. You

3143
00:51:39,653 --> 00:51:40,174
Speaker2: made it

3144
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:41,075
Speaker2: up. You don't

3145
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:41,716
Speaker2: believe me.

3146
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:42,837
Speaker2: Facts

3147
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,341
Speaker2: what did you say?

3148
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:49,184
Speaker2: Feelings

3149
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:49,545
Speaker2: need to be

3150
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,586
Speaker2: facts.

3151
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:52,929
Speaker1: No, I said

3152
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:53,850
Speaker1: your feelings

3153
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:54,570
Speaker1: are not

3154
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:55,692
Speaker1: based on

3155
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:56,773
Speaker1: any

3156
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:57,674
Speaker1: objective

3157
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:58,595
Speaker1: and reasonable

3158
00:51:58,675 --> 00:51:59,196
Speaker1: facts.

3159
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:00,457
Speaker1: But that's what I

3160
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:00,778
Speaker1: said.

3161
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,820
Speaker1: Yeah.

3162
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:03,977
Speaker1: You were

3163
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:04,638
Speaker1: unable to

3164
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:05,619
Speaker1: articulate for

3165
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:06,279
Speaker1: me any

3166
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:06,900
Speaker1: fact

3167
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:08,601
Speaker1: that, for

3168
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:09,482
Speaker1: example, if

3169
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:10,183
Speaker1: you had

3170
00:52:10,283 --> 00:52:10,683
Speaker1: called the

3171
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:11,304
Speaker1: police,

3172
00:52:11,784 --> 00:52:12,565
Speaker1: the police were going to

3173
00:52:12,705 --> 00:52:13,125
Speaker1: ask you,

3174
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:14,306
Speaker1: OK, well,

3175
00:52:14,587 --> 00:52:15,427
Speaker1: what did he say

3176
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:16,308
Speaker1: or do that

3177
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:17,149
Speaker1: made you think

3178
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,730
Speaker1: that that

3179
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,611
Speaker1: he's a threat?

3180
00:52:21,112 --> 00:52:21,413
Speaker1: Because.

3181
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:23,394
Speaker1: Because

3182
00:52:23,514 --> 00:52:24,095
Speaker1: just being

3183
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:24,796
Speaker1: angry

3184
00:52:25,897 --> 00:52:26,737
Speaker1: by itself is

3185
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:27,098
Speaker1: not a

3186
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:27,958
Speaker1: threat.

3187
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,019
Speaker1: angry, but

3188
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,460
Speaker1: I'm not

3189
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,360
Speaker1: threatening you and

3190
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:31,141
Speaker1: I'm not going to

3191
00:52:31,241 --> 00:52:31,742
Speaker1: physically

3192
00:52:31,822 --> 00:52:32,502
Speaker1: harm you in

3193
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:33,263
Speaker1: any way.

3194
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,120
Speaker2: You weren't on that

3195
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,540
Speaker2: call,

3196
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:36,822
Speaker2: like his

3197
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:37,502
Speaker2: tone of voice,

3198
00:52:37,703 --> 00:52:37,943
Speaker2: like you

3199
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:40,246
Speaker2: weren't on that

3200
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:43,149
Speaker2: call.

3201
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:44,050
Speaker2: And it showed his anger by

3202
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:44,550
Speaker2: his emails.

3203
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:45,912
Speaker2: I haven't listened to his

3204
00:52:45,972 --> 00:52:46,793
Speaker2: voicemail. He didn't sound as

3205
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:47,634
Speaker2: angry, but like he

3206
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:48,875
Speaker2: continued texting me and

3207
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,356
Speaker2: calling me.

3208
00:52:49,897 --> 00:52:50,718
Speaker1: Well, yeah, I've,

3209
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:51,278
Speaker1: I've read the

3210
00:52:51,378 --> 00:52:52,039
Speaker1: emails and it

3211
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,481
Speaker1: does come across

3212
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:53,941
Speaker1: that he's

3213
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:55,103
Speaker1: upset.

3214
00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:00,812
Speaker2: at the end of this,

3215
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:01,453
Speaker2: he's

3216
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:02,877
Speaker2: going

3217
00:53:02,897 --> 00:53:03,700
Speaker1: to

3218
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,161
Speaker1: stab

3219
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:04,863
Speaker1: anybody

3220
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:05,364
Speaker1: or

3221
00:53:05,405 --> 00:53:06,307
Speaker1: like,

3222
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:06,909
Speaker1: none of that

3223
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:07,651
Speaker1: is what

3224
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,554
Speaker1: he's saying. What he's

3225
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:09,436
Speaker1: saying is I'm

3226
00:53:09,576 --> 00:53:10,359
Speaker1: angry and I'm going to

3227
00:53:10,419 --> 00:53:10,860
Speaker1: sue you.

3228
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:15,880
Speaker2: Yeah, but at the end of the

3229
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,081
Speaker2: day,

3230
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:17,443
Speaker2: Latasha, you're

3231
00:53:17,503 --> 00:53:18,023
Speaker2: telling me that

3232
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:18,985
Speaker2: I'm wrong.

3233
00:53:19,305 --> 00:53:20,106
Speaker2: You're disappointed.

3234
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:21,629
Speaker2: Like, I was feeling

3235
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:22,810
Speaker2: completely wrong. Like,

3236
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:23,592
Speaker2: I just, I

3237
00:53:23,712 --> 00:53:24,333
Speaker2: don't know. I'm just

3238
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:24,914
Speaker2: dumbfounded, I

3239
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:25,955
Speaker2: guess. Again, I've

3240
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:26,816
Speaker2: never been in this kind of

3241
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:27,638
Speaker2: situation before. Never

3242
00:53:27,698 --> 00:53:28,339
Speaker2: had any...

3243
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,181
Speaker1: Any

3244
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:31,203
Speaker2: employee

3245
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:32,124
Speaker2: goes off, but

3246
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:32,825
Speaker2: I'm

3247
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:34,187
Speaker1: just...

3248
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:34,748
Speaker1: We're both

3249
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:35,589
Speaker1: flabbergasted

3250
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:36,611
Speaker1: here because

3251
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:37,873
Speaker1: I...

3252
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:38,794
Speaker2: I don't feel any

3253
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:39,275
Speaker2: support from

3254
00:53:39,335 --> 00:53:39,936

00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:42,079
Speaker2: targeted.

3258
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:42,558
Speaker2: I

3259
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:43,158
Speaker1: feel like

3260
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:44,300
Speaker1: HR went

3261
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,201

Speaker1: I feel like,

3265
00:53:48,786 --> 00:53:49,467
Speaker1: like you

3266
00:53:49,547 --> 00:53:50,068
Speaker1: had us

3267
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:51,029
Speaker1: jumping off

3268
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:51,951
Speaker1: of a plank for

3269
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:52,211
Speaker1: you

3270
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:53,513
Speaker1: straight

3271
00:53:53,553 --> 00:53:54,394
Speaker1: into the ocean

3272
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:55,095
Speaker1: with no

3273
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:55,696
Speaker1: support

3274
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:56,117
Speaker1: because

3275
00:53:56,197 --> 00:53:56,737

00:53:57,378 --> 00:53:58,039
Speaker1: HR is

3277
00:53:58,099 --> 00:53:58,540
Speaker1: left.

3278
00:53:59,001 --> 00:53:59,481
Speaker1: No, let me be

3279
00:53:59,561 --> 00:53:59,902
Speaker1: clear.

3280
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:01,104
Speaker1: We're left with the

3281
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:01,744
Speaker1: egg on our

3282
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:02,105
Speaker1: face,

3283
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:02,866
Speaker1: justifying

3284
00:54:03,026 --> 00:54:03,767
Speaker1: why we sent an

3285
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:04,328
Speaker1: employee

3286
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:04,809
Speaker1: home

3287
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:05,790
Speaker1: off

3288
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,711
Speaker1: of your safe

3289
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:07,172
Speaker1: though.

3290
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,111
Speaker1: when there was

3291
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,871
Speaker1: no legal

3292
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:10,832
Speaker1: basis for us

3293
00:54:10,913 --> 00:54:11,573
Speaker1: to do that.

3294
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:12,795
Speaker1: And we deprived

3295
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:13,655
Speaker1: him of pay,

3296
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:14,757
Speaker1: which he's already

3297
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:15,397
Speaker1: complaining

3298
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:15,778
Speaker1: about

3299
00:54:16,138 --> 00:54:16,759
Speaker1: without

3300
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:17,419
Speaker1: proper

3301
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,040
Speaker1: legal

3302
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:18,721
Speaker1: basis,

3303
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:19,562
Speaker1: because we

3304
00:54:19,742 --> 00:54:20,443
Speaker1: accepted

3305
00:54:20,563 --> 00:54:21,143
Speaker1: your word

3306
00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:21,624
Speaker1: for it,

3307
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:22,545
Speaker1: that he was

3308
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,286
Speaker1: threatening you.

3309
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:24,127
Speaker2: And I told you

3310
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:24,907
Speaker2: how I felt. And if you

3311
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:25,748
Speaker2: don't believe that it was

3312
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:26,469
Speaker2: enough, then that's

3313
00:54:26,509 --> 00:54:26,810
Speaker2: fine.

3314
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,411
Speaker2: Then maybe you should have

3315
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:29,312
Speaker2: called, maybe that's what I'm

3316
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:29,613
Speaker2: saying,

3317
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:30,714
Speaker2: Latasha. If it was

3318
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:31,495
Speaker2: this serious, then

3319
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:32,556
Speaker2: we should have had this

3320
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:33,136
Speaker2: conversation

3321
