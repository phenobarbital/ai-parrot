# AI-Parrot API Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your actual values

# API Base URL (without trailing slash)
# This is where your AI-Parrot backend is hosted
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Production example:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.your-domain.com

# The login endpoint will be constructed as:
# ${VITE_API_URL}/api/v1/login

# Notes:
# - Remove 'http://' or 'https://' if your apiClient already handles it
# - Don't include '/api/v1' in the base URL as it's part of the endpoint path
# - Ensure your backend has CORS properly configured for this origin
