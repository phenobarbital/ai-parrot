# TASK-3065: Implement model-free FTS and native hybrid search

**Feature**: FEAT-542 - Local LanceDB Vector, Full-Text and Hybrid Search
**Spec**: `sdd/specs/lancedb-vector-store.spec.md`
**Status**: pending
**Priority**: high
**Estimated effort**: M (2-4h) — target 4 hours
**Depends-on**: TASK-3064
**Assigned-to**: unassigned
**Parallel**: false
**Parallelism notes**: Sequential/gated task. Last normal backend writer. Use exact APIs from the gate; an async function wrapping a synchronous SDK call without offloading is not sufficient.
**Acceptance coverage**: AC4, AC5, AC6

---

## Context

Complete M3 with lexical and native fusion retrieval over the same persisted table.

The spec is marked approved. Its checked section 8 answers require fully offline agent operation after provisioning, concurrent independent writers, graph federation only, and whole-origin failure; they override older draft assumptions. TASK-3057 must reconcile the spec and prove the SDK/offline/concurrency contracts before dependent implementation begins. Do not reinstate single-writer-only or storage-only-offline behavior.

---

## Scope

- Implement fulltext_search and hybrid_search with signatures fixed in spec section 2; retain explicit collection/filter/parent scope and validated limits.
- FTS must neither instantiate nor call the provider, including after reopening with stored embedding identity or with an unusable configured model.
- Use native FTS and explicit vector+query-text hybrid with the gate-proven SDK builders and one conjunctive prefilter across both legs.
- Map FTS to SearchResult carrying native BM25 metadata and its documented legacy alias; return LanceDBHybridHit for RRF with no distance alias.
- Any failed hybrid leg raises for that origin; no successful partial fallback. Confirm inserts after index creation, upserts and deletes are visible in all query modes without manual maintenance.

**NOT in scope**: Toolkit reranking changes, graph seed replacement, generic hybrid interfaces, silent fallback and destructive index maintenance.

## Files to Create / Modify

| File | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/src/parrot/stores/lancedb.py` | MODIFY | fulltext_search and hybrid_search |
| `packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_lancedb_fts_hybrid.py` | CREATE | Real FTS/fusion/filter/freshness tests |

Ownership is exclusive to this task for the listed responsibility. You are not alone in the codebase: preserve others' changes, do not revert unrelated edits, and accommodate completed dependency work. New files listed here are proposed outputs, not already-verified imports. Shared backend files are deliberately sequenced by dependencies.

---

## Codebase Contract (Anti-Hallucination)

Verified by source inspection on `dev` on 2026-09-10. This is not a claim of runtime SDK/import testing. Re-read relevant definitions before implementation; if paths/signatures changed, update the contract first. Symbols delivered by dependencies must be verified in their committed files before import.

### Verified Imports

```python
from parrot.models.stores import SearchResult  # packages/ai-parrot-tools/src/parrot_tools/multistoresearch/origins/vector.py:11
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field  # packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/models.py:13
from parrot.stores import AbstractStore  # packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_namespace_imports.py:151
```

### Existing Signatures to Use

| Verified source | Existing contract |
|---|---|
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:245` | async similarity_search(self, query: str, collection: Union[str, None] = None, limit: int = 2, similarity_threshold: float = 0.0, search_strategy: str = 'auto', metadata_filters: Union[dict, None] = None, include_parents: bool = False, **kwargs) -> list. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:258` | Documented parent exclusion: is_full_document=True OR document_type in ('parent', 'parent_chunk'); unmarked legacy rows remain eligible. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/models/stores.py:74` | SearchResult.distance returns score without conversion; FTS compatibility must not pretend BM25 is a vector distance. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/models.py:19` | Document(page_content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]); metadata defaults to an empty mapping. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/models/stores.py:46` | SearchResult requires id: str, content: str, score: float; distance at :74 returns score unchanged. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/models/stores.py:79` | OriginHit has optional id/score, content/metadata, origin, origin_kind and native_rank >= 1. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/models/stores.py:162` | StoreConfig has embedding_model, dimension=768, metric_type='COSINE', index_type='IVF_FLAT', table/schema/dsn and extra. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:326` | create_embedding(self, embedding_model: dict, **kwargs) uses registry.get_or_create_sync; arbitrary dict fields are not automatically forwarded (Matryoshka is explicitly forwarded). |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:383` | async generate_embedding(self, documents: List[Any]) -> List[Any] initializes a default provider if absent, then awaits embed_documents. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:391` | _apply_contextual_augmentation(self, documents: list, _log: bool = True) -> list[str] mutates document.metadata['contextual_header']; use copies. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/embeddings/base.py:169` | async embed_documents(self, texts: List[str], batch_size: Optional[int] = None) -> List[List[float]]. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/embeddings/base.py:188` | async embed_query(self, text: str, as_nparray: bool = False) -> Union[List[float], List[np.ndarray]]; default is a single flat vector. |
| `packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/src/parrot/embeddings/huggingface.py:134` | SentenceTransformerModel.__init__(self, model_name: str, matryoshka: Optional[dict] = None, backend: Optional[str] = None, file_name: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs). |

### Does NOT Exist

- No backend-neutral hybrid_search contract is defined by AbstractStore.
- fulltext_search and typed LanceDB hybrid results are new backend contracts, not inherited query implementations.
- LanceDBConfig, LanceDBHybridHit and lancedb_models.py are new task deliverables, not current core types.
- A shared HybridSearchResult or globally comparable origin score does not exist.
- Calling base generate_embedding is not model-free lexical retrieval.
- Do not assume arbitrary offline/local_files_only fields in embedding_model reach the provider; verify forwarding before relying on them.
- New helpers listed in dependency tasks are not pre-existing repository APIs. Use the gate/completion contracts, then verify their actual implementations.
- No guarantee of fully offline inference or concurrent-process correctness follows merely from opening a local LanceDB directory.

## Implementation Notes

### Pattern to Follow

Last normal backend writer. Use exact APIs from the gate; an async function wrapping a synchronous SDK call without offloading is not sufficient.

Use the existing contracts above without changing unrelated shared behavior. Keep async public operations non-blocking, strict type hints, Pydantic structured records and black/isort formatting. Keep SDK access inside the embeddings backend, never in the origin adapter.

### Key Constraints

- Complete only this task's deliverable; do not implement later tasks opportunistically.
- Never remove or silently downgrade approved offline or concurrent-writer requirements.
- No schema overwrite, broad deletion, automatic version pruning, remote fallback or new storage server.
- Preserve caller documents and shared embedding ownership. Do not log document text, vectors, credentials or filter values.
- Respect optional dependency boundaries; follow approval policy before introducing unapproved packages.
- Capture test commands, dependency versions and outcomes under `artifacts/logs/TASK-3065-lancedb.log`; real-model/benchmark evidence must distinguish provisioning from execution.

### References in Codebase

The task-specific locations above and the spec's sections 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 are authoritative. Read any additional implementation API before relying on it; do not guess builder methods from a class name.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Native FTS and hybrid pass real-SDK tests and preserve raw score direction/provenance.
- [ ] Model-free lexical reopening passes I5 with zero embedding construction/inference calls.
- [ ] All-mode visibility and filtering pass I3/I4; hybrid errors propagate.
- [ ] Full backend suite passes without modifying core result semantics.
- [ ] Tests in this task's Test Specification pass; failures are not hidden by mocks, skips or relaxed assertions where real SDK/model execution is required.
- [ ] Scope-owned code passes formatting/type checks appropriate to the repository, and the completion note records actual commands and evidence.

---

## Test Specification

| Test | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| `test_fts_no_model_construction_after_reopen` | Lexical identifier resolves with provider constructor/inference rigged to fail. |
| `test_hybrid_lexical_and_semantic_candidates` | Known lexical-only and semantic-only matches are eligible in native fusion. |
| `test_all_modes_share_prefilter_and_parent_rules` | All filter/parent combinations enforced before per-leg limits. |
| `test_all_modes_follow_upsert_delete_and_reopen` | Index freshness and mutation visibility using real SDK. |
| `test_failed_hybrid_leg_raises` | No empty success or vector-only fallback when FTS/model fails. |

Intended command after dependencies are implemented:

```bash
uv run pytest packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_lancedb_fts_hybrid.py packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_lancedb_vector_search.py -v
```

These are test contracts, not executed test results or placeholder production implementations. Use pytest-asyncio for async cases, temporary directories for datasets, bounded subprocess joins, and explicit process barriers for race tests. Reuse the deterministic 8-D fixture unless real local model evidence is explicitly required. Required feature tests may not all skip just because the SDK or assets were omitted.

## Agent Instructions

1. Read the spec and the approved-answer precedence in this task.
2. Work only inside the FEAT-542 feature worktree. Verify dependency tasks are `done` in `sdd/tasks/index/lancedb-vector-store.json` and their task files are under `sdd/tasks/completed/`.
3. Re-verify every needed import/signature and dependency-produced helper before writing code.
4. Update only this task entry in `sdd/tasks/index/lancedb-vector-store.json` to `in-progress`, with assignment/start timestamps. Never use the historical monolithic index.
5. Outline the implementation plan and uncertainties, then implement within the listed file ownership. Preserve unrelated work.
6. Run all task acceptance checks and save logs; unresolved gate failures prevent completion.
7. Move this task to `sdd/tasks/completed/TASK-3065-lancedb-native-fts-hybrid.md`, update its per-spec entry to `done` with completion time and file path, and fill the completion note.
8. Commit only scoped implementation plus this task's SDD state. Follow the execution/review workflow before pushing.

## Completion Note

**Completed by**: not started
**Date**: not completed
**Notes**: Pending execution; no implementation or acceptance tests run during task decomposition.
**Deviations from spec**: The checked answers supersede stale prose; TASK-3057 reconciles that discrepancy before implementation.
