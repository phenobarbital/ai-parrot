# TASK-3063: Implement contextual ingestion, upserts and safe deletion

**Feature**: FEAT-542 - Local LanceDB Vector, Full-Text and Hybrid Search
**Spec**: `sdd/specs/lancedb-vector-store.spec.md`
**Status**: pending
**Priority**: high
**Estimated effort**: M (2-4h) — target 4 hours
**Depends-on**: TASK-3060, TASK-3062
**Assigned-to**: unassigned
**Parallel**: false
**Parallelism notes**: Sequential/gated task. Only this task edits backend mutations. Later query task verifies cross-mode visibility; test-only lifecycle harness may remain until similarity_search is implemented.
**Acceptance coverage**: AC3, AC4, AC8

## Context

M2 mutation delivery, using the schema/identity/compiler/coordinator contracts already completed.

The spec is marked approved. Its checked section 8 answers require fully offline agent operation after provisioning, concurrent independent writers, graph federation only, and whole-origin failure; they override older draft assumptions. TASK-3057 must reconcile the spec and prove the SDK/offline/concurrency contracts before dependent implementation begins. Do not reinstate single-writer-only or storage-only-offline behavior.

---

## Scope

- Implement from_documents as prepare/add/return store and add_documents against an existing prepared collection; empty ingestion is a no-op.
- Validate all input IDs/metadata before writes; copy documents for contextual augmentation, persist original text and derive stable IDs before augmentation.
- Validate every generated vector batch and merge-insert upserts under process-safe coordination with snapshot refresh. Report committed batch count on partial failure; stable-ID retry is idempotent.
- Implement explicit document/ID deletion and typed metadata deletion with safe selector validation, parents included when selected, and exact deletion counts under the same coordinated transaction.
- Exercise two writer processes on disjoint IDs and the same ID; acknowledged writes survive reopen without duplicate logical IDs. Follow gate-defined conflict semantics, not an invented last-writer rule.

**NOT in scope**: Search implementation, automatic schema migration, delete-all, distributed transactions and all-batch rollback promises.

## Files to Create / Modify

| File | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/src/parrot/stores/lancedb.py` | MODIFY | from_documents, add_documents and deletion methods |
| `packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_lancedb_mutations.py` | CREATE | CRUD, contextual text and multi-process mutation tests |

Ownership is exclusive to this task for the listed responsibility. You are not alone in the codebase: preserve others' changes, do not revert unrelated edits, and accommodate completed dependency work. New files listed here are proposed outputs, not already-verified imports. Shared backend files are deliberately sequenced by dependencies.

## Codebase Contract (Anti-Hallucination)

Verified by source inspection on `dev` on 2026-09-10. This is not a claim of runtime SDK/import testing. Re-read relevant definitions before implementation; if paths/signatures changed, update the contract first. Symbols delivered by dependencies must be verified in their committed files before import.

### Verified Imports

```python
from parrot.stores import AbstractStore  # packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_namespace_imports.py:151
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field  # packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/models.py:13
from parrot.models.stores import SearchResult  # packages/ai-parrot-tools/src/parrot_tools/multistoresearch/origins/vector.py:11
```

### Existing Signatures to Use

| Verified source | Existing contract |
|---|---|
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:117` | AbstractStore.__init__(self, embedding_model: Union[dict, str] = None, embedding: Union[dict, Callable] = None, **kwargs); configured provider eagerly created at :155. |

| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:216` | Nested __aenter__/__aexit__; _free_resources at :222 calls provider.free(). Subclass must preserve borrowed-provider ownership. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:238` | get_vector(self, metric_type: str = None, **kwargs); get_vectorstore(self) at :241 delegates. |

| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/abstract.py:326` | create_embedding(self, embedding_model: dict, **kwargs) uses registry.get_or_create_sync; arbitrary dict fields are not automatically forwarded (Matryoshka is explicitly forwarded). |

| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/stores/models.py:19` | Document(page_content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]); metadata defaults to an empty mapping. |

| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/models/stores.py:79` | OriginHit has optional id/score, content/metadata, origin, origin_kind and native_rank >= 1. |
| `packages/ai-parrot/src/parrot/models/stores.py:162` | StoreConfig has embedding_model, dimension=768, metric_type='COSINE', index_type='IVF_FLAT', table/schema/dsn and extra. |

### Does NOT Exist

- LanceDBStore and a LanceDB process-shared coordinator do not yet exist.
- AbstractStore's connection/context state is not a cross-process transaction mechanism.
- Calling base generate_embedding is not model-free lexical retrieval.
- Do not assume arbitrary offline/local_files_only fields in embedding_model reach the provider; verify forwarding before relying on them.
- LanceDBConfig, LanceDBHybridHit and lancedb_models.py are new task deliverables, not current core types.
- A shared HybridSearchResult or globally comparable origin score does not exist.
- New helpers listed in dependency tasks are not pre-existing repository APIs. Use the gate/completion contracts, then verify their actual implementations.
- No guarantee of fully offline inference or concurrent-process correctness follows merely from opening a local LanceDB directory.

## Implementation Notes

### Pattern to Follow

Only this task edits backend mutations. Later query task verifies cross-mode visibility; test-only lifecycle harness may remain until similarity_search is implemented.

Use the existing contracts above without changing unrelated shared behavior. Keep async public operations non-blocking, strict type hints, Pydantic structured records and black/isort formatting. Keep SDK access inside the embeddings backend, never in the origin adapter.

### Key Constraints

- Complete only this task's deliverable; do not implement later tasks opportunistically.
- Never remove or silently downgrade approved offline or concurrent-writer requirements.
- No schema overwrite, broad deletion, automatic version pruning, remote fallback or new storage server.
- Preserve caller documents and shared embedding ownership. Do not log document text, vectors, credentials or filter values.
- Respect optional dependency boundaries; follow approval policy before introducing unapproved packages.
- Capture test commands, dependency versions and outcomes under `artifacts/logs/TASK-3063-lancedb.log`; real-model/benchmark evidence must distinguish provisioning from execution.

### References in Codebase

The task-specific locations above and the spec's sections 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 are authoritative. Read any additional implementation API before relying on it; do not guess builder methods from a class name.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] U4 mutation cases pass with stable IDs and correct metadata/text preservation.
- [ ] All required abstract ingestion/deletion operations are implemented, not no-ops.
- [ ] Exact counts, conflict handling and cancellation match the reconciled spec.
- [ ] CRUD state survives fresh-process reopen and never silently deletes an unrestricted collection.
- [ ] Tests in this task's Test Specification pass; failures are not hidden by mocks, skips or relaxed assertions where real SDK/model execution is required.
- [ ] Scope-owned code passes formatting/type checks appropriate to the repository, and the completion note records actual commands and evidence.

---

## Test Specification

| Test | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| `test_reingestion_upserts_and_preserves_original_text` | Identity and contextual metadata stable; caller inputs unchanged. |
| `test_invalid_batch_never_writes_invalid_rows` | Dimensions, finite values, duplicate IDs and zero vectors validated. |
| `test_partial_failure_retry_is_idempotent` | Only successful batches durable and error reports completed count. |
| `test_delete_selectors_and_exact_counts` | Empty/conflicting/unknown selectors fail; actual deleted count correct. |
| `test_two_process_crud_no_lost_acknowledged_writes` | Separate processes and fresh-process reopen prove the approved write contract. |

Intended command after dependencies are implemented:

```bash
uv run pytest packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_lancedb_mutations.py packages/ai-parrot-embeddings/tests/test_lancedb_lifecycle.py -v
```

These are test contracts, not executed test results or placeholder production implementations. Use pytest-asyncio for async cases, temporary directories for datasets, bounded subprocess joins, and explicit process barriers for race tests. Reuse the deterministic 8-D fixture unless real local model evidence is explicitly required. Required feature tests may not all skip just because the SDK or assets were omitted.

## Agent Instructions

1. Read the spec and the approved-answer precedence in this task.
2. Work only inside the FEAT-542 feature worktree. Verify dependency tasks are `done` in `sdd/tasks/index/lancedb-vector-store.json` and their task files are under `sdd/tasks/completed/`.
3. Re-verify every needed import/signature and dependency-produced helper before writing code.
4. Update only this task entry in `sdd/tasks/index/lancedb-vector-store.json` to `in-progress`, with assignment/start timestamps. Never use the historical monolithic index.
5. Outline the implementation plan and uncertainties, then implement within the listed file ownership. Preserve unrelated work.
6. Run all task acceptance checks and save logs; unresolved gate failures prevent completion.
7. Move this task to `sdd/tasks/completed/TASK-3063-lancedb-upserts-safe-deletes.md`, update its per-spec entry to `done` with completion time and file path, and fill the completion note.
8. Commit only scoped implementation plus this task's SDD state. Follow the execution/review workflow before pushing.

## Completion Note

**Completed by**: not started
**Date**: not completed
**Notes**: Pending execution; no implementation or acceptance tests run during task decomposition.
**Deviations from spec**: The checked answers supersede stale prose; TASK-3057 reconciles that discrepancy before implementation.
