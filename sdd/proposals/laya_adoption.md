# Laya: Jev replacement

Laya is a multilingual, non-autoregressive System 1 decision engine. Typed decisions over 100+ languages in a single forward pass — 33 ms — trained with reinforcement learning against strictly proper scoring rules (RLCD), with a router that picks the right checkpoint per request.

Laya used typed questions over any state (text, JSON documents) with small context.

Laya not only can be used as a classification model used by any LLM client inside of ai-parrot (and as an utility inside of ToolManager for data classification invoked by any agent) but also as optional drop-in replacement for LLM guardrails (prompt injection evaluation, PII redaction, content moderation) and model routing under Workflows (AgentCrew, AgentsFlow) but also under agents where questions can be routed to cheaper internal models with a faster decision than now.

## installation:
```
pip install laya
```

Quickstart code for Route Mode:
```
import laya
from laya import Router

# Preload checkpoints into memory for instant sub-35ms routing
router = Router(preload=True)

# 1. State in any language or schema
state = {
    "from": "user@acme.com",
    "subject": "Duplicate charge on invoice #4411",
    "body": "Hi, we were billed twice for March. Please refund the duplicate today or we will cancel our plan."
}

# 2. Define your typed questions
questions = {
    "department": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which department should handle this request?",
        "criteria": {
            "billing": "invoices, payments, refunds",
            "technical": "bugs, outages, system errors",
            "sales": "pricing, new contracts",
            "other": "everything else"
        }
    },
    "urgency": {
        "type": "score",
        "instructions": "How urgent is this request?",
        "criteria": ["not urgent", "soon", "critical deadline or blocking issue"]
    },
    "churn_risk": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user threaten to cancel or leave?"
    },
    "refund_requested": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user explicitly request a refund?"
    }
}

# 3. English state -> automatically routed to laya (ModernBERT-large, 39.5 ms)
res_en = router.predict(state, questions)
print("Department :", res_en["answers"]["department"]["choice"])  # -> billing (confidence: 0.94)
print("Routing    :", res_en["routing"]["model"])                 # -> english

# 4. Hindi state -> automatically routed to laya-multilingual (mmBERT-base, 32.8 ms)
res_hi = router.predict({"body": "मुझसे दो बार शुल्क लिया गया, कृपया पैसे वापस करें।"}, questions)
print("Department :", res_hi["answers"]["department"]["choice"])  # -> billing (confidence: 0.86)
print("Routing    :", res_hi["routing"]["model"])                 # -> multilingual

# 5. Explicit override when you want a specific checkpoint
res_td = router.predict(state, questions, model="typed-decisions")
```
