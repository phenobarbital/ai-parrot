"""Avatar session orchestrator (FEAT-242 Phase A — Module 5).

Phase A glue that opens a LiveAvatar LITE session (with ``livekit_config`` so
the avatar joins our LiveKit Cloud room), consumes ``bot.ask_stream()``, runs
the ``SpeakableFlattener`` + sentence segmenter, synthesizes each sentence to
raw PCM via Supertonic (``synthesize_pcm``), and pushes the PCM frames to the
``AvatarWebSocket``.

Ownership:
- Opens the LiveAvatar session (TASK-002).
- Awaits the WS ``connected`` gate (TASK-003).
- Mints room tokens (TASK-004).
- Flattens + segments streamed text (TASK-005).
- Guarantees ``stop_session`` + WS close + keep-alive cancellation in ``finally``.

``synthesize_pcm_fn`` is an injectable callable that converts text → raw PCM
bytes (int16 LE mono 24 kHz).  This decouples the orchestrator from the ONNX
runtime for testing and allows plugging in Kokoro later without touching this
module.

Open questions deferred to owners:
- P6: per-sentence latency / 400 ms first-chunk feasibility on target hardware
  is unconfirmed.  # TODO P6 — tune chunk timing if needed after profiling.

Design note — ``synthesize_pcm_fn`` vs ``VoiceSynthesizer``:
``VoiceSynthesizer.synthesize()`` wraps the PCM in a WAV container, which is
NOT the format required by the AvatarWebSocket (raw PCM int16 LE 24 kHz).  The
raw PCM path is ``SupertonicPipeline.synthesize_pcm()`` (``supertonic_inference.py:528``).
Callers should inject this callable directly; see the module-level helper
``make_supertonic_pcm_fn()`` for a ready-to-use factory.

    PERFORMANCE: constructing a ``SupertonicPipeline`` loads ONNX models and
    is expensive (seconds).  In production, build ONE pipeline at application
    startup and pass it via ``pipeline=`` so it is reused across requests —
    do NOT call this factory per request without a shared ``pipeline``.
